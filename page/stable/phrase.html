		`You see a shorter, younger Quarg, likely a child in Quarg years, being shown around the ringworld by an adult. It seems like the parent is teaching the child about the ring.`
		`A Quarg is standing uncomfortably close to the walls, tapping it slowly with both palms. You observe it for a few minutes, until it stops abruptly and goes about its business like the others.`
		`Usual activity in the ringworld is stopped by a few dozen Quarg in heavily armored suits moving at a quick pace and escorting a large, tube-like container which floats to accompany them. Other Quarg are quick to make way for the group, allowing themselves a great distance from the armored Quarg.`
		`Some Quarg scientists are dragging along a whole train of linked lab carts, packed fully with utensils, chemicals, components, and reagents. It takes nearly half an hour before you see the last of the carts pass by.`
		`Hundreds of Quarg are blocking one of the largest, widest corridors in the ring. They're all sitting down on the floor, staring down blankly in complete silence, with a scarce few seldom glancing up to the ceiling only to move their gaze downwards once again. You notice that Quarg who witness the scene stop all conversation and move elsewhere.`
		`One Quarg walks up to you, and stares down into your eyes. It stays there in silence, just looking at you, before finally blinking once and moving along, disappearing into the ring's hallways.`
		`A Quarg is overseeing the unloading of dozens of ship-sized cargo containers that have arrived in the ring. It seems to mentally count the cargo as it's moved out in perfectly identical sets. After what must've been thousands of cargo tons, it clicks off one of dozens of small dots on a data pad and begins counting again.`
		`Two Quarg ships land at the same time a few hangar bays away from one another. They open their hatches, and what must be the ships' entire crews come out. Without a hitch the crew of each ship boards the other's ship and depart.`
		`The Quarg seem to have set up some form of festival in the ring: endless stands stretch out as far as you can see, all displaying variations of the same orange-like fruit, ranging from impossibly smooth to unbelievably wrinkled, and also from sizes as small as a pea to as large as a watermelon. You can't figure what quality they like best.`
		`You see one Quarg turn a sharp corner in what's a haste by their standards. When you look into the corridor it went to, you see it's a dead end, with the Quarg having inexplicably vanished.`
