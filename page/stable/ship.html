	description "After the Korath were exiled from their homelands, efficient resource collection became a priority. World-ships were too precious to risk on dangerous forays, and Raiders lacked the cargo capacity. The Dredger was born as an answer to this problem, featuring an abundance of cargo and passenger space, with formidable defensive armament. With such a complement, these bulky ships can also offer potent support for frontline Raiders."

	description `These hardy little cargo ships are the perfect size for young Arachi just setting out into the sky with dreams of one day building their own merchant fleets. Of course, an Arach lucky enough to be born into one of the great Houses can probably find a patron to buy them a much larger ship instead.`

	description `Arach cargo ship hulls are legendary for their durability. It is not uncommon for a large Arach family to convert a freighter that is no longer space-worthy into a planet-side dwelling, and even in the harshest of conditions these converted houses can last for hundreds of years with little or no exterior maintenance.`

	description `The Arach Hulk is an ungainly, lumbering behemoth of a ship, but with its side pods removed it becomes the much more maneuverable Spindle. Because of its much lower cargo space, usually the only reason a fleet would include a Spindle is if they are planning on picking up new cargo pods at their destination.`

	description `During their time battling the Quarg, the Coalition focused on producing the strongest, toughest warships they could, so fightercraft were out of the question. Now, however, the Heliarch's shield matrix and hull integrity technology is much more advanced, and they have recently experimented with such ships. The Judicator was made for transportation of these new fighters.`
	description `	Alongside their six fighter bays, Judicators come with a large bunk count and higher cargo space than other Heliarch warships, thus doubling as a logistics vessel for transporting troops and equipment.`

This 'Ember Waste Node,' as it is being called, bears a superficial resemblance to void sprites but is clearly a different species.

Most remarkably, it has been seen appearing and disappearing with an energy signature reminiscent of jump drives."

	description `To fuel their increasing need for materials, the Gegno designed a new ship class for the sole purpose of mining. The resulting platform, the Gypsum, is not much more than a flying drill with cargo containers, engines, and a bridge attached behind it, making it cost-efficient and easy to manufacture.`
	description `	Because Gegno engines are not very powerful, the Gypsum has difficulty chasing faster-moving asteroids. In order to alleviate this problem without needing to massively increase the engine space on the ship, the Gegno have instead developed the powerful Excavator Drill, which can shred asteroids in a matter of seconds, meaning the Gypsum only needs to be near an asteroid for a mere moment in order to mine it.`

	description `Dunites are unique vessels designed by the Gegno Vi entirely for the purpose of dueling. It is a hodgepodge of parts, simply being an engine, power system, cockpit, and Irate Cannon mashed together without any regard to structural integrity. The most notable feature is a long mace-like protrusion next to the Irate Cannon which is used for jousting and ramming other duelists.`
	description `	Being a mangled mess of machinery designed for only a single purpose, Dunites do not come equipped with nor have room for hyperdrives, and are purely intrastellar craft.`

	description `The Augen-Class is an ancient battleship proposed by the Vi as a large weapons platform for their Ballistic Cannons. It was built in secret over many years in Enbi's canyon shipyard, and for many periods of time its construction was put on hold. The recent civil war with the Scin gave reason to complete the warship, although it is still somewhat of a relic compared to current vessels in the service of the Vi fleet.`
	description `	This project was meant to result in two sister-ship behemoths, but the blueprints for the other design went missing early in the process, and are currently nowhere to be found.`

	description `Based on the Gegno's old Dolomite, the Schist is a mid-range ship used by the Vi. It can carry a decent amount of cargo, and has enough bunks to carry a whole platoon of warriors. It is the primary vessel used to transport recruits to the front lines, and veterans back to home territories.`
	description `	Although is it lightly armed compared to other Vi ships, Schists still are mounted with a pair of forward facing cannons and a turret so they can bring some type of weaponry to any possible engagement, as well as a set of angled guns for deterring any smaller, faster ships from attempting to flank the vessel.`

	description `While the style of longer battleship-esque vessels is a Gegno Vi staple, another shipyard rose to the competition for Vi warship designs. The Eclogite is one of the newest designs in the Vi fleet - a gunboat armed to the teeth with cannons, and maneuverability that the Vi's larger ships lack. It plays the role of a hit-and-run vessel, unloading volleys of shells against a target's armor in a rapid maneuver before adjusting its position for another run.`

	description `Hornfels are the workhorse of the Gegno Vi's military - decently sized, decently fast, and more than decently armed warships designed for the frontline of operations. Hornfels are also the most configurable ship in the Vi's fleet, lined with many mounting points to support cargo pods, allowing them to provide a secondary transport role for when the Vi require replacement supplies in war. Other variants of Hornfels are instead occasionally found with adjustments to carry a larger armament. This multi-role function is extremely valued and is the reason why the Hornfel is one of the Vi's most popular ships.`

	description `Gneiss battleships are the Gegno Vi's true sword and shield in war. They are slightly older than the Hornfels and Schists, but carry the heaviest armament, bearing three huge mounts dedicated to holding enormous Ballistic Cannons. Gniess also have extremely strong armor plating, and can take a hefty beating while firing threatening broadsides at the opposing force.`
	description `	Unfortunately, in exchange for huge firepower and defensive armor, they lack speed and maneuverability, even when fitted with the largest engine systems the Vi have to offer.`

	description `Granulites are descendants of the Gegno's early generation ships used to colonize nearby systems before the invention of the hyperdrive. They now carry hundreds of Vi both in and out of war, and huge cargo loads to supply depots. They are not typically used as warships, but can support enough weaponry to threaten most smaller vessels, or fend off larger ships long enough for reinforcements to arrive.`

	description `Coesites are smaller warships that the Scin use as screening vessels during battles with the Vi. They are speedy and carry two turret mounts which allow them to always be orbiting and firing on the move. Being a smaller design, these ships are relatively easy to manufacture, and are often fielded in groups so they may overtake vessels much larger than them.`

	description `Built upon a similar frame to the Coesite, the Tridymite serves as a small luxury transport vessel for the Gegno Scin. Tridymites are typically used as research vessels, transporting crews of scientists from one location to another, or as private vessels for top ranking Scin scientists. Additionally, Tridymites can occasionally be seen used as a scout craft by the military, equipped with an early prototype scanner system built into the frame.`

	description `Felsics are based on Schists, but offer many upgrades in exchange for less durability.

	description `The mighty Feldspar is a Scin creation to behold. As a testbed for the new Halite fighters, Feldspars bring their own small fleets with them and overwhelm their enemy. They were also designed as a semi-experimental platform, built around a brand new multi-engine system and the latest in Gegno plasma technology.`
	description `	Able to keep a decent stance away from a battle while putting down artillery fire, Feldspars are quite a dangerously well-rounded ship for their size. On the downside, they are more susceptible to hull damage like any other Scin warship, especially when alone. As such, they rely on their fighters to keep their enemies at a distance.`

	description `Epidotes are large independent research platforms with adequately-sized cargo holds, allowing them to perform as a reliable heavy freighter for the Gegno Scin. A large number of bunks either help transport groups of Scin scientists to their project destinations, or allow for mobile on-board demonstrations and observations. Each Epidote is equipped with a rear fighter docking bay capable of carrying two Halites, typically used to ship Halite fighters around Scin space to resupply carriers. Thanks to these fighters and the Epidotes' three dorsal turrets, they can also be used as a secondary warship when needed.`
	description `	Like other Gegno Scin ships, Epidotes themselves are an experimental test bed; they are built around the same large engine system tested on Feldspars, making them notably fast for their size.`

	description `Kyanites are intricately-built test platforms for Gegno Scin technology, equipped with an extensive built-in power system and energy reserve able to support many types of outfits. Weapon experimentation, the most common practice of Kyanites, is recorded by various scanner instruments littering the two long structures on the front of the hull. Despite being weapon research vessels, Kyanites are not combat-capable due to how exposed their systems are and how little hull covers them. These systems are also very expensive and difficult to produce, so only a small amount of Kyanites are found in service.`
	description `	The scanner system found on the Tridymite was originally developed and tested on Kyanite platforms, eventually becoming integrated into the hull as well.`

	description `The introduction of humans to the Hai civilization has led to a substantial amount of cultural exchange. While some may argue that pickled acorns have been the greatest product of this relationship, many more will point to this luxury transport ship. The product of human-Hai cooperation from the project's inception, the Centipede was released around the turn of the 31st century, but has already become quite popular among Hai fleets.`

	description `A design nearly as old as the Aphid, practically no new Cicadas have been built in recent memory; it is so reliable that the second-hand market is saturated Cicadas that have outlived not just one pilot, but in many cases multiple whole lineages of Hai that have owned one and passed it down through the generations. This feature is likely the main factor which has kept the popularity of the Scarab in check as well as defining the Yeer e Ki shipyard's motto: "Service for Life."`

	description "The Hai upgraded their original Pond Strider after acquiring hull repair technology through alien diplomacy. These improvements have greatly reduced casualties in their conflict with the Unfettered, since the light Pond Striders become vulnerable as they collect damaged drones. Besides enabling the ship to repair damaged drones, the Hai have cleverly innovated the Skipper Railgun to make the Pond Strider and Fleas into very efficient combat support for their fleets."

	description "The Sea Scorpion was designed several decades ago to serve as a mobile platform to launch Trackers. However, it is only recently that the Unfettered have been able to mass-produce them. While individually vulnerable, the reduced cost of manufacturing compared to Shield Beetles allow the materially inferior Unfettered to gain a numerical advantage against their brethren."

	description `The hard-working cousin to the Lightning Bug, the Scarab has only ever grown in popularity, never declined. That this statistic is occasionally measured in thousandths of a percentage point for years at a time is immaterial to the title. This lightweight transport is commonly the pick for Grasshopper pilots looking to make money while continuing to feed their free spirit. It is also large enough to transport a large Hai family, making it perfect for nearly any odd job in Hai space.`

	description "Before the Shield Beetle, the Hai used the Titan Beetle, a weaker but more capable ship of a similar design. The Emperor Beetle is a Titan coated with many layers of modern armor, making it a more powerful warship than anything else the Hai have built in modern times. Unfortunately, the advanced features are quite expensive, so these ships are used sparingly as flagships and trophy ships."
	description "	As it is not meant to plunder but to lead in glorious battle, many of the cargo bays were removed and converted to space for weapons and defensive improvements. This change came at the cost of increased mass and lowered agility, but that is a sacrifice the Unfettered are more than willing to make."
	description "	More than just a ship, the Emperor Beetle was built to inspire fear in its enemies, making it known that they face no simple Hai, but the military leaders of the Unfettered leading at the front of those they command. Some believe it to be foolish to show their leaders' ships in such a manner, but that is not how the Unfettered think. This ship was built to withstand far more punishment than any normal Shield Beetle, while still being able to dish out damage of its own."

	description "The design of the Water Bug is almost as old as the Aphid, but until recently it never saw much use. A spike in aggression from the Unfettered Hai has led the tougher and more well-defended Water Bug to see an increase in popularity over its little brother, the Aphid. The Water Bug is now the most widely used Hai freighter, comprising the bulk of all Hai merchant fleets."

Dry tonnage alone keeps it from being classified as a heavy warship.`

Much of the stock cargo space has been converted to space for outfits, weapons, and engines; coupled with a streamlining of existing internal systems, it makes the prospect of meeting this flexible war machine in an uninhabited system seem pretty unappealing."

It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance."

	description `Though the Syndicate doesn't build fighter carriers, it is testing the waters with the Barb, a cheap and flexible carrier-launched craft featuring newly-developed miniaturized ion engines. The design philosophy of the Barb seems to have been "uglier than the Protector," and as you look at the cockpit nestled between the massive gun port and turret mount, you wonder where the power systems are supposed to go. Though an awkward-looking ship, it seems flexible enough to become a dangerous addition to any fleet with carriers.`
	description "	In order to be capable of fitting a Proton Gun while still maintaining a turret mount, Syndicated Systems had to remove various life support systems, requiring that the pilot wear a pressurized suit rather than having the cabin be fully pressurized. Although it makes piloting a Barb an uncomfortable experience, the result is a level of short-range firepower that is unheard of for a craft its size."

	description `After introducing the "Type F" cargo pod for the Hauler, it became apparent to merchant captains that the new carriers could offer more flexibility within their fleet, if there were a cargo box they could attach to the fighter arms. Enter the "F6-C: Boxwing," the Fighter that doesn't fight, but carries cargo instead. Cargo preservation equipment gives the Boxwing much more mass and very poor heat dissipation characteristics compared to other fighters. That it cannot carry any weapons is only part of the reason jocks call it "Flying Coffin" amongst themselves; besides the ship resembling one and being very sluggish, the pilot "seat" doubles as a bunk, and is cramped beyond the comfort level of most. The interactive panoramic window H.U.D. is the only thing that keeps claustrophobic episodes from becoming a major problem.`

	description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate cargo ship, able to carry as much cargo as four ordinary Syndicate Freighters. Its on-board gearing allows it to service even the most primitive colonies, though dock workers in busier spaceports often joke that it would be simpler to carry smaller freighters within its gigantic holds."
	description "	It is also an incredibly slow and difficult to maneuver ship, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of Bulk Freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

It is a tough, slow brawler that is most often used by warlords to protect their properties, whether it'd be their ships or hideouts from raids by either the authorities or their rivals. Due to their lack of speed and cargo space these ships rarely participate in raiding merchant convoys outside their home system.`

	description `Prior to the formation of the galactic Republic, many star systems were owned by "governing corporate entities," with the vast majority of space being inaccessible to private citizens. The only exception to this rule were the pirate bands, whose few ships were often stolen or rebellious corporate fleets of their own, yet who had an outsized impact on interstellar trade. The necessity for corporations to protect their operations meant that Enforcer was one of the most common vessels used for security and defense. The ship boasts an armament of four gun ports and a turreted mount, all packed on a small but defensible frame that was powerful for its time.`
	description `	Although no longer on the market, the Enforcer finds itself in the possession of a small number of merchants and, ironically, various groups of pirates, as an aging combat ship easily outperformed by other light warships or even interceptors of a similar size.`

In its time it possessed relatively good maneuverability for a ship of its size, but now it sees continued use mostly due to the sheer number of them already built for service."

Haulers were first created simply by bolting a cockpit and engine block onto a cargo container, and the basic design has not changed much since then."

Hawks are fast enough to chase down most smaller ships, but are capable of mounting much more powerful weapons. They are also, of course, a favorite ship of pirate captains who have earned enough money to afford one."

	description `First manufactured by a forgotten shipyard many centuries ago, the Hogshead got its iconic name from the keg-like shape of its engine pods; its design was a hot topic of discussion for captains everywhere. The ship quickly became popular after first being released for consumer purchase and was commonly seen around various systems as the go-to "space bus" in human space.`
	description `	Unfortunately, only a few decades after introducing the ship, the shipyard went bankrupt and was never heard from again, leaving the Hogshead to history as their one-hit-wonder. In the current era, Hogsheads are much less common; they are considered "unsightly" compared to modern vessels such as the Star Queen, though a few places in human space still sell them.`

	description "The semi-autonomous Mining Drone is used by the Syndicate alongside the Sunder mining vessel in a supportive role. Not being much more than a Mining Laser with an engine stuck to the rear of it, these drones do not last long in combat with other ships due to how fragile they are."
	description "	Drones do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a drone unless you have a ship in your fleet with a drone bay."

	description "The Mule is as much of a hodgepodge as its looks suggest. The Lionheart ship designers combined a good deal of cargo space with a decent amount of weaponry and even a fighter bay, and ended up with a ship that is mostly used as a freighter but can also be used as a warship because of its heavy armament and shields. This hodgepodge nature has its downside, though, namely its high crew requirement and the fact that any dedicated ship of the same cost will do better in a specialized role than the Mule will."

	description `Southbound Shipyards quickly answered the Free Worlds' call for a carrier by building modified cargo containers for Haulers - adding a pair of Fighter docking arms, some additional outfit space, and even a couple of bunks. Access to the fighters from within the ship is so inconvenient that most pilots opt to just stay aboard their fighters when in flight. While the technical name for this ship is "Hauler I: Type F," Southbound assembly workers started calling the single container variant the "Nest" due to its complement of Finch Fighters, and the name stuck.`

Because of its speed and long weapons range, the Quicksilver can keep a safe distance from most targets and bombard them with particle bursts until they are destroyed. Unfortunately the Headhunter eventually surpassed the original design intent, but the Quicksilver's better durability to cost ratio, and the existence of long-term contracts, has kept it in use with Syndicate security forces."

	description "During the caravan era, a boom of economic development spread along the paths of more heavily armed and technologically advanced merchant fleets originating from the Deep, which resulted in ships such as the Saber being developed. This medium warship was one of the powerhouses of military might in its time, armed to the teeth with five gun ports in the nose and a dorsal turret mount to fire at anything not in front of it. As pirates began to join together in larger war bands in response to the more heavily defended merchants, the Saber became popular amongst them as well. Unlike other ships such as the Firebird, it slowly faded out as competition rose, but it is nevertheless cherished by those who still own one."

	description "The Lionheart Scoutship was designed back in the days when the galaxy was more sparsely populated, and ships prospecting for habitable worlds or worlds rich in resources would often travel far away from any habitable ports where they would be able to refuel. Although the galaxy has now been much more thoroughly explored, the Scout remains a popular ship for long-distance travel."

	description "Rather than being a specific model of ship, the Scrappers are instead a family of vessels cobbled together from the remains of broken shuttles. On the rare occasion that Republic authorities bother to recognize their existence, Scrappers are treated as almost-illegal, patent-infringing death traps. Despite this, these ships are where many captains (and pirates) from poorer backgrounds get their start."

	description "Although Betelgeuse Shipyards produces other ship models as well, the majority of their profits come from sales of the Shuttle. This versatile ship serves equally well as a passenger transport or a cargo courier. It also happens to be the cheapest ship you can buy which is capable of hyperspace travel."
	description `	Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat of any sort, but they are fast and maneuverable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship. Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, "as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft."`

	description `This particular cockpit and engine set has found itself attached to three of Southbound Shipyards' new "Type F" Fighter-carrier pods. When the Free Worlds asked for a carrier, they did not expect one that would be able to carry more fighters than even the heaviest Navy warships. Given this fact, the Free Worlds have asked Southbound and Tarazed to restrict sale of the "Hauler III: Type F," "Skein" to its Militia only.`

	description "Classified as an interceptor rather than a fighter because it has its own hyperdrive instead of needing to be carried inside a larger ship, the Tarazed Sparrow is the smallest and cheapest combat ship available. Because of its limited cargo and passenger space, the primary way for a Sparrow pilot to pay the bills is to upgrade the weapons and hunt pirates... or become one. In either case, it is a perilous way to earn a living."
	description "	Government reports indicate that as many as two out of every three first-time ship buyers who choose to pilot a Sparrow lose their ship (and often, their life as well) within the first month of owning it. Pilots who have survived longer than that tend to swear by replacing the stock weapons with missile launchers."

	description "The Star Queen is a relic of a more peaceful period of galactic history: a luxury liner for high-end tourists. Every cabin has its own mini-bar, and the bathrooms have marble tile and showers that use actual hot water instead of chemicals or sonic vibrations."
	description "	In support of environmental movements across the galaxy, all Star Queens come standard with an array of solar panels as their only source of energy as opposed to more popular power generators such as fuel cells or nuclear reactors that produce some amount of waste. Although some argue that this is a pointless move given the prevalence of clean fusion reactors, others have applauded it and cited the prohibitive costs of fusion reactors as a reason for using solar panels."

	description "After the Korath were exiled from their homelands, efficient resource collection became a priority. World-ships were too precious to risk on dangerous forays, and raiders lacked the cargo capacity. The Rano'erek-class Asteroid Dredging Ship, named for a respected civilian politician and economist, was born as an answer to this problem."
	description "	Featuring an abundance of cargo and passenger space in addition to their formidable defensive armament, these bulky ships can also offer potent support for frontline Palavrets."

	description "Successive raider designs have been the Korath warship of choice for plundering neighboring species for generations. Named for a celebrated captain who gave her life to ensure her crippled vessel made it back to port with its desperately needed cargo of stolen fish, the Palavret-Class Raiding Ship continues that grim tradition."
	description "	Like all Exile ships, the Palavret has been adapted to house as many Korath as possible, as comfortably as possible, inflating its size beyond similarly armed warships. The spaceborne construction techniques employed allow for the ship's easy replacement, facilitating continued raids of nearby systems."

	description "The venerable Palavret has been a mainstay of the Korath raiding fleet, elements of its design dating back from before the era of shortages and desperation caused by a life in exile. Over forty generations of raiders have terrorised neighboring systems over the centuries."
	description "	Constant warfare against surrounding aliens has been building pressure on Korath shipyards to recover some of their ancient prowess. Now, with a fresh industrial network to draw upon, the Korath have created a new raider to deal with modern targets, and the Tubfalet-Class Raiding Ship is named for an admiral who dealt with such enemies. Despite extensive injuries, he remained on his flag bridge during a Remnant attack, leading his squadron to victory."

	description "While perhaps, at first, seeming like a super-sized 'olofez-Class Carried Chaser, the 'nra'ret-Class Chaser is not only the first truly unique warship design the Exiles have fielded since the Exodus, but also the first built solely for combat instead of needing to double as a habitat or supply ship. Its size and non-modular nature also means it must be constructed wholesale at the largest Korath facilities, something that, until recently, was generally reserved for the likes of the massive Ik'atilajej and the Korsmanath A'awoj."
	description "	The 'nra'ret-Class Chaser, named in honor of a brilliant weapons engineer who took their own life to avoid having their secrets captured by a hostile alien force, provides the Exiles with a fast and powerful patrol striker both in support of large raiding fleets and as independent units. To this end, it is armed with numerous missile ports designed to rain fire on enemies from afar. It also carries a pair of langrage heavers for sustained operations, and two Fire-Lances for emergency use in close quarters."

	description `These small probes are primarily deployed by larger Korath Exile ships to scan for intruders, evaluate foreign vessels, and analyze system bodies. Their secondary function is to retrieve small debris and deactivated microbots spread across Korath space which have fallen off their ships, been fired from Shunt-Strikes, or were even deliberately deployed. Although the data observed and logged by an individual microbot is extremely limited, processing them in bulk yields a valuable gestalt of information. More importantly, the microbots can be recycled for use afterwards.`

	description "Although fierce in battle and highly adaptable, Korath do not easily recover from injury. Without the aid of a surgeon or more equipment than fits into a standard escape pod, a stranded, injured Korath faces poor odds of survival. Therefore, Korath who leave their home territory have placed great importance on the construction of hospital ships that can quickly locate, recover, and treat the survivors of wrecked ships."
	description "	The Rai'alorej-Class Refuge, named for a pioneer in the field of microbot-assisted surgery, is thoroughly appointed with lifeform scanners, locator beacon receivers, ambulances, and search-and-rescue teams. Once onboard, crash victims are greeted with the finest hospital facilities, microbot treatments, and stores of medicine the Exiles have at hand. Even incubators and nurseries are available to treat the young who grow up aboard ship."

	description "For most of their manufacturing needs, the Korath rely, as even some terrestrial species do, upon their space station and asteroid infrastructure. Due to their spacebound existence, however, the acceptability for failure and downtime is slim to nonexistent. Should equipment aboard a station or a world-ship fail, the Ikatila'ej, named for an inventor famously proficient in a variety of fields, is called in to provide critical support. Its microbot-run factory produces basic living supplies, machine parts, and systems cores, and may assist in continuing stalled production."
	description "	When not assisting with damaged ships and stations, or replenishing its own stores, the Ikatila'ej serves as an all-in-one recycling, mining, refining, and factory ship, using its microbot-powered grinder to rapidly turn asteroids and garbage into whatever products the civilian economic planning committees have determined to be in the most dire need."

	description `Originally designed as a luxury habitat for those wealthy enough to escape living on the polluted surface of Korath worlds, when the Korath were exiled, it was into these gargantuan "world-ships" they first crammed themselves into and fled to the core on. Nostalgically, the class was then renamed after the devastated and now forbidden Korath homeworld.`
	description `	Since the introduction of purpose-built city ships, these ancient vessels have mostly been decommissioned, turned into stations, or reconfigured into smaller, specialized vessels. Yet a few still ply the starlanes, crewed by those too restless to live on stations yet not bold enough to go on raids.`

	description "Korsmanath A'awojs, named in memory of the Korath home system, are massive nomadic habitats that hold much of their remaining population. True flying cities, they could be self-contained miniature worlds were it not for their heavy defensive armament and reliance on unsustainable materials, methods, and sources of power."
	description "	Commission of new Korsmanath A'awojs is a resource-demanding, labor-intensive, painstaking process fraught with political intrigue. Navarchs fight with the civilian government for resources and yard time they would rather devote to building raiding and defensive fleets, civilians vie with each other for a place on the next ship, and planning committees argue with engineers over what methods and technologies to use. This leads to construction delays, corner-cutting, and over-militarization of the design at best, and violent feuds at worst."

Facing very different challenges, and taking some inspiration from their Quarg protectors, the Efreti descendant of the "World-Ships" of old is lighter, faster, and more efficient, but less powerful than its Exile counterparts.`

	description "Although they do not effectively provide for their own defense, the Efreti remain responsible for the day-to-day needs of civilian and cargo transportation. While not as bulky or powerful as other Korath designs, this freighter is much faster at making runs back and forth between the Efreti's handful of remaining planets, while still holding enough defensive loadout to ward off the odd Mereti drone that slips past the Quarg."

	description "A recent design, this Efreti multi-role vessel is found taking up many jobs previously relegated to a now scrapped fleet of early-model raiders. While some are used primarily for passenger transport, others are used in local mining to satiate the Efreti's perpetual demand for ores. Incorporating Quarg-inspired structural elements, its light frame allows it to complete tasks more nimbly than any other independent Korath ship."

	description "	Since the Remnant do not have schematics for the Dromedary, just the highly-modified example of the Shattered Light, this ship is actually a commemorative replica of that specific ship. As such, it combines the original's odd mix of eclectic modifications with new Remnant systems."

	description "While the Starling was the first successful ship to use technology derived from alien ruins, the Gull is the most recent. The current increase in Korath activities has caused foraging for resources to become a risky endeavor, forcing the Remnant to develop a specialized freighter for hauling cargo from remote sites without revealing their presence to hostile aliens."
	description "	The Gull has quickly proven its worth, allowing the Starling fleets to return to riskier activities while the Gull takes over the hazardous convoy routes. It is now the primary element of the Remnant's extra-territorial resource operations."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Gull's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "The Heron is the Remnant's ultimate last resort: Flight. These mobile starports are built to serve as the core elements of evacuation fleets when the Remnant are ultimately pushed to the brink of destruction in their home systems. These massive ships are capable of lifting enormous amounts of resources and operate both in space and on land, and are continuously updated to make full use of the latest technological innovations."
	description "	The few Herons in existence are carefully guarded secrets that embody the Remnant's core tactics of speed, stealth, and survival. Given the tiny number that exist, they are never available for discretionary use by Remnant captains and are always operated under the authority and direction of a prefect."

	description "The Ibis is a multipurpose carrier that serves as a mobile mining platform, an escort ship for Pelican fleets, and a combat platform using Terns for screening. It is capable of fielding a single wing of support craft, consisting of two Petrels and four Terns."
	description "	The Ibis was designed shortly after the Albatross as a means of extending the range of resource collection efforts after the Remnant realized that an Alpha invasion might not be as imminent as originally believed."

	description "The Pelican is closely based on the original semi-organic materials the Remnant found in the Ember Waste. While they are not technically alive, their internal mechanisms and method of construction bear such a close resemblance to living organisms that they are often considered as such. One key feature of this living resemblance is the innate sensory capabilities they possess, akin to sensor suites less advanced ships require for detailed scanning. These ships serve as the backbone of Remnant bulk salvage efforts, as well as their fast-logistics distribution network."

	description "The Peregrine is the first capital warship designed by Taely using fresh insights garnered from recent experimentation as well as renewed studies of the void sprites. Encompassing over a century of development since the last generation of warships was built, it is the forerunner of a new breed of Remnant ships."
	description "	The Peregrine was designed along the lines of old-earth's fast-attack cruisers. Drawing on inspiration from its namesake, famed for being the fastest self-propelled lifeform on Earth, it is designed to strike hard and fast. It closes quickly with enemies to unleash devastating barrages in the opening seconds of combat."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Peregrine's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "The Petrel is a multi-role mining/wing leader fightercraft designed to provide support for flights of lighter Terns in high-risk environments. The ship's design originated as an urban mobile gun platform that flitted around structures and natural terrain, but proved easy to adapt into a spacecraft."
	description "	The Remnant are loath to sacrifice pilots and crew from the comparatively small pool they are drawn from. As such, their fighters are equipped with medium-range weaponry designed to strike enemies from afar."

	description "The Remnant have long favored turns of action that avoid putting crew directly at risk; though their Terns are a rather effective result of this ideology, the Remnant still had to face the fact that, eventually, one of their manned ships was going to end up too crippled to escape to safety. To that end, the Smew was developed; though quite lightly armed, Smews are capable of carrying a considerable quantity of cargo and passengers for a ship of their size, and are durable enough to absorb some fire from enemies while doing so."
	description "	Though originally designed as lifeboats, the surprisingly mobile freighter-fighter hybrid has seen a remarkable amount of usage in mining fleets, as a way to supplement the otherwise poor cargo capacity of the Ibis. Because their purpose can vary from fleet to fleet, Smews are traditionally sold with a fair amount of free space: enough for a small weapon, upgraded engines, or additional support systems."
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."

	description "One of the strangest and most useful things that the Remnant have discovered in the abandoned worlds of the Ember Waste is alien cloaking technology.

	description "The Tern is a small, hardy drone developed to plunge into the atmosphere of nearby gas giants for collecting valuable resources. These thick-shelled craft are also surprisingly effective when pressed into service as screening ships when enemies intrude into Remnant space."
	description "	Unlike most spacefaring nations, the Remnant do not have enough people to pilot fighter wings in waves likely to sustain significant casualties. As such, they frequently use these hardy drones to fulfill similar screening roles in their home systems, allowing manned craft to focus on more specialized tasks."

	description "An ancient Sheragi warship that was crewed by mutineers that fled from their civil war and escaped into interstellar space. Found orbiting a disconnected star, this is an impressively large ship, fit for the equally large Sheragi. The ship's main weapon is a fusion-pumped gamma-ray laser called the 'Dragonflame Cannon.' Despite the relatively primitive outfits, it's still a very capable war machine due to its size."
	description "For its original Sheragi masters, this warship was home to around 100 individuals. For others, however, that number more than doubles, bringing it on par with the largest city ships."

	description "The Sheragi, being too large to effectively pilot ships this small, invested heavily in the development of autonomous fighters. The hardware that controls this isn't much more complex than the combat drones in human space, but it is bigger, and the lack of life support systems and amenities for a pilot allows it to carry extra outfitting space."
	description "	The fighter also comes equipped with a powerful hull repair system to aid in its survival. This system doesn't work while the fighter is under fire, though, requiring the fighter to have not taken damage for a short while before activating."
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."

	description `This creature appears to have an outer shell made of small asteroids held together by strands of carbon nanotubes. It pulls rocks through arms into its main cavity where it processes them to make more shell. The multi-colored hairs pointing back seem to be a drive system of sorts, manipulating the gravity field around the creature to accelerate it. There is no apparent hyperdrive mechanism, but somehow it is able to open a hyperspace window.`
