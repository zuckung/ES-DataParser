			"A sizable crowd is watching one of the monitors in the spaceport where an interviewer is speaking to a Heliarch agent. You learn from someone in the crowd that the agent was a professional athlete until recently."
			"A news broadcast shows footage of many Heliarch agents arresting a group of terrorists. The Heliarch who was supervising the operation is later interviewed, explaining that the now prisoners were found to have stolen government equipment."
			"The news show a Heliarch consul giving a short speech in a ship launching ceremony. After they finish, the brand new Heliarch warships are shown heading to their first patrol."
			"All the spaceport screens momentarily swap to a broadcast from the Heliarch government, where they show a video of several dozens of arrested criminals. The Heliarch host describing the event mentions their sentences range from 40 years to life, prompting varying reactions from the civilian spectators."
			"During one of the more busy hours on the spaceport, the news details the crimes of a recently arrested terrorist group: arson, kidnapping, theft of government equipment, possession of weapons, conspiring against the Coalition, attacking both government and civilian properties, subversion... The list goes on for a few more minutes."
			`After the latest report on how the Heliarchs arrested some terrorists on a nearby world, the news shows various short clips with the same message, asking the public to "stay vigilant" and report any and all suspicious activity.`

			"A short film plays on a monitor during a commercial break. A young Saryd walks in a forest, looking to his sides every few seconds to take in the view. Eventually he turns to see another Saryd, both surprised. As he approaches her and the two start talking, the camera pans out to a rising sun over the forest."
			"A local screen shows a stressed Saryd working at a computer late at night. The door creaks, and she looks back to find her children peeking. She puts them to sleep and then goes to bed herself. After waking up, she finds nobody around the house. She goes outside, seeing the children, along with their father, admiring the sun rising."
			"After a government broadcast, a timelapse plays on a spaceport monitor, showcasing Ring of Friendship gaining more and more solar panels on its exterior over the centuries."
			"During a break, a recruitment advertisement plays. A recruit of each species is shown putting on their brand new uniforms, then training on some sort of obstacle track, and then the view switches to troops marching in unison in the Academy of Cadets of Belug's Plunge."

			"Coalition families have formed a line to a large cargo ship. Brought by their parents, the children are one by one giving away blankets, outdated electronics, and all sorts of toys, which are all carefully packed into cargo containers. It seems they are donating to a charity organization."
			"Charity workers are meeting with a few wealthy-looking individuals in the spaceport. Apparently all the expenses of the endeavor are paid by donations, and they are trying to bring in some new patrons to expand the efforts."

			"I just don't get why anyone would pick the pirate life. Sure, no rules, but any government that doesn't force you to have 10 licenses just to look at a heavy warship is free enough to me."
			"I've heard rumors of captains seeing the distinct flash of whatever Quarg ships use to jump near the core. Wonder what the Quarg are doing up there."
			"Being a pirate must be a lose-lose scenario. You do badly and you end up enslaved to a stronger pirate. You do well and you get enough attention to get targeted by the Navy or Militia."
			"I think that people are too harsh towards pirates. Not all of them are heartless."
			"Be careful when taking suspicious jobs. You might end up at the wrong end of a gun."
			"Always check the spaceport for jobs. Some of them pay quite well."
			"Falcons are the best! They're faster and sleeker than any other civilian warship!"
			"Leviathans are the best! They're tankier and can hold more firepower than any other civilian warship!"
			"Why would anyone use a Falcon? They have specifications worse than the Leviathan in every way, and Falcon hulls cost more to produce."
			"How could anyone use a Leviathan? They're dreadfully slow and an eyesore to look at."
			"Don't be fooled by the Falcon's low retail price! Once you strip out all the outfits, you'll find that the hull costs more than a Leviathan's."
			"People may tell you otherwise, but I think that Vanguards are the best. They have such powerful frontal weaponry."
			"Warships may have both speed and weaponry on their side, but if you're looking for something to last, use a Behemoth."
			"I don't get how people could get worked up over what ship to use. As long as I'm in my trusty Protector, I'm happy."
			"Ugh. Why are fighter pilots so gung-ho about charging right into the guns of their enemies? At the very least, don't make me waste hundreds of thousands of credits replacing my ships when you kill yourself."
			"Don't you think it's strange that the Navy lets you buy their offensive fighters but not any of their other ships?"
			"I wonder why shipyards haven't capitalized on making alternatives to the Navy combat drone. Probably because the only ships that can use drones are Navy ships, I guess."
			"Some of the names that captains give their ships are awful. Seriously, I've seen ships named 'Ship.'"
			"I'm convinced merchant captains make the worst jokes."
			"What's up with the Deep? One moment, they have a defense force on par with the Navy, the next, they're asking random schmucks to help escort their fleets. How the mighty have fallen, I guess."
			"I swear: Sparrows are so laughably weak that Flivvers are a better option for an interceptor."
			"I was doing some jobs in the Core, when an enormous alien warship jumped in and attacked! People say I'm crazy, but I'm lucky to have gotten out of there with my life!"
			"The Syndicate tries to keep alien attacks under wraps, but if you've been around as long as I have, you'll see them eventually."
			"I was working a Syndicate defense job once, expecting to only deal with some pirates. Instead, I had to drive off an alien warship that jumped in same way the Quarg do! They made us sign a non-disclosure agreement, so don't tell anyone I said that."
			"Take caution when doing bounty jobs. After it's accepted, only the bounty hunter is allowed to attack the target. Not even the Navy can help out."
			"I once got hired by someone in search for his true love; he didn't know which ship she left in, so we traveled to dozens of planets to search for her... until he ran out of credits."
			"I once had a passenger that was returning to the spaceport where she met her true love. I still wonder if they ever got together again."
			"I once put 50,000 rifles and 150,000 grenades into my armory. Some of the grenades in the bottom became embedded in the floor because of all the weight on top of them. I still can't get one of them out."
			"I felt lonely, so I participated in Romantic Matchmaking on a Syndicate planet, but that was a big scam! They never asked anything about the type of partner I was looking for, they only asked questions about what I wanted to buy in the next 10 years."
			"I once joined Romantic Matchmaking organized by the Syndicate, but they couldn't tell me anything about my true love due to privacy concerns. Can you believe that?"
			"Romantic Matchmaking as organized by the Syndicate is garbage; they don't even differentiate on gender."
			"I once got married, but my partner didn't allow me to fly further than 5 systems away. Guess what? I'm now more than 5 systems away from my ex-partner."
			"I once married somebody with no credits, and I lost half of my fleet when we divorced."
			"I really found my true love in one of those Romantic Matchmaking programs; my love always joins me on every flight I'm on. We're a great team."
			"I often join those Syndicate Romantic Matchmaking programs; they're a great source to pick up crew members that work for free - at least until they find out. Then I dump them on whatever planet I'm visiting."
			"Truck drivers in the old days were required by law to take a break every 2 hours. Can you imagine that in our business? Stopping our ships every 2 hours to take a rest?"
			"I once had some Flat Earthers as passengers. They claimed that the planets we saw are 2 dimensional circles instead of 3 dimensional spheres."
			"Some Flat Earthers accused me of playing propaganda videos on the ship's viewports when they looked out of the ship while we were in orbit."
			"There's no point crying over spilt milk. But the bill for cleaning the 200 tons of milk that leaked from my ship is no laughing matter either."
			"I spy with my little eye... something large, flat, and sturdy. The landing pads! How did you know?"
