	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2,503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 433,567 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`
	name
	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

	`	By the time you reach the end of the checklist, it has grown uncomfortably warm. The air smells like ozone and hot metal, and your cameras are showing a plume of steam or smoke escaping from the hull near the engines. If your systems are running this hot while still in the atmosphere, they're likely to overheat the moment you hit hard vacuum. You are going to have to either install cooling systems, or trade out some components for lower-heat alternatives.`

	`	"Excellent! According to a friend of mine who is versed in history from the war, there were rumors that a grand library was being built in the Deep to house all of human knowledge. If it exists..." She stops when she notices you nodding with a knowing expression. "You have already been there? Well, you certainly get around, Captain &#60;last&#62;. I suppose that makes things rather straight forward."`
	`	"I actually already have a copy of the library's data in my ship," you respond.`
	`	"Oh, that's even better," Taely trills. "Go ahead and get it."`
	`	You return to your ship to get the data chip, but when you glance out the cockpit you notice that the spaceport is more animated than usual. Remnant look to be running to their ships as fast as they can when you notice that Taely is halfway up the side of your ship securing a refueling hose and charging cable. As you reach for the commlink she scrambles up to the bridge windows and quickly rattles off a series of signs at you. All you can make out is "Keep it hot, incoming!" Before you can frame a reply she has raced across your wing and leapt to the Albatross parked next to you.`

	`Having acquired a copy of the archive, you gently set your ship down on Viminal hoping that this information is helpful. The port seems unusually busy, but the comm channels are quiet beyond the bare minimum to keep traffic organized.`
	`	Before you have even taken the time to shut down the engines Taely is halfway up the side of your ship securing a refueling hose and charging cable. As you reach for the commlink she scrambles up to the bridge windows and quickly rattles off a series of signs at you. All you can make out is "Keep it hot, incoming!" Before you can frame a reply she has raced across your wing and leapt to the Albatross parked next to you.`
	label launch
	`	Looking around more carefully, you note that every ship in the port is idling with fuel lines still connected. If this were some Republic port the safety inspectors would be having a nightmare. One Starling is getting holes in its wings patched even as the crew appear to be running prep-for-flight checklists. It also looks like every ship has a guard. Something tells you that right now would be a bad time to take a walk around town.`
	`	After some tense minutes of waiting, the planetary defense sirens start and the idling ships begin to ascend one by one. You quickly figure out where you are in the launch sequence and follow the stream of craft heading for orbit.`

"Contact with a new species! How very exciting," he says. "I am glad for Sayari that such an opportunity has been presented to her. But our speaking machines are very valuable. Before I give one to you, will you do a small favor for me?"`

	`	Your question seems to utterly confuse him. "Information," he says. "It is what you call a non-rival good, is it not? When I give information, I do not lose it. Sharing it costs me nothing. The librarians, surely they will understand this. Have no fear."`

	`	"I have spent my whole life studying human culture," he says. "This is a treasure to me. And now, here is your speaking machine." He hands you a small, spherical device, with speakers and microphones mounted on it, as well as what look like camera lenses. "The device is programmed with the human and Hai languages," he says. "It is not always possible to translate perfectly between our two languages, but it will try to give you a sense of the range of meanings in what is being said."`
	choice
		`	"Thank you. I'm eager to try it out!"`
			accept
		`	"Is there anything else I need to know?"`
	`	He humors you by demonstrating how the machine works, holding a conversation with you where he speaks in the Hai language, and the machine automatically translates for you and then translates your responses back into his language. It apparently uses its cameras to track who you are speaking to or listening to. It's an impressive piece of technology, and easy enough to use. You thank him for his help, and return to your ship.`

	`You give the message from Sayari to the spaceport authorities so that they can deliver it to the council of elders. After the message has been delivered, the council requests that you meet with them.`
		goto start
	label altStart
	`	When you arrive on &#60;planet&#62;, you are quickly escorted from the spaceport to the council chambers.`
	label start
	`	"Greetings again, &#60;first&#62; &#60;last&#62;," one of the elders says to you. "It is our understanding that our Unfettered brothers and sisters have created a carrier ship. How difficult was it for you to combat it?"`
	choice
		`	"The carrier is strong, but not strong enough, and can be easily taken down."`
		`	"It was easy for me, but I can't say it will be the same for your ships to combat."`
		`	"It was a difficult fight, as the carrier is very powerful."`
	`	The elders mumble among themselves about this information, periodically glancing down at what must be the message from Sayari detailing the Solifuge.`
	`	"We gather a large fleet above Cloudfire," one of the elders says, "and shortly afterward the Unfettered unveil this new ship. Perhaps it is only right that we respond in kind with a ship of our own."`
	`	"My son is an engineer," another elder says. "He helped create our Centipede and Geocoris ships, both as a result of the humans living among us. Perhaps he would be of assistance in creating a ship to respond to the Unfettered." The elder presses a button and leans over to a microphone. "Please bring Osen into the council chamber."`
	`	A short while later, the elder's son enters the chamber and introduces himself to the council. They tell him about the Unfettered having created a carrier and the need for a new ship to be created as a response, and Osen's eyes go wide.`
	`	Osen begins speaking very quickly in the Hai language, so fast that your translation device seems to barely be able to keep up.`
	`	"I have [exactly, precisely] the ship! My team has been [developing, producing] a ship for many [years, cycles] that carries a [fleet, squadron] of drones. We have [working, functional] [prototypes, models], but they are not yet [finished, complete]. We are still [developing, producing] technology to repair the [hull, armor] of a ship in flight, which would make this ship and its drones much more [effective, powerful]."`
	`	The device continues speaking to you for nearly a minute after Osen stops talking (which is a little awkward as everyone stares at you). "Sorry, I wasn't aware that you had a translation device," Osen says, no longer speaking in Hai.`
	choice
		`	"It's alright."`
			goto next
		`	"You talk really fast."`
	`	Osen shrugs and smiles at you. "I speak fast when I'm excited."`
	label next
	`	"When is the earliest that you could provide these ships to us?" Osen's father asks.`
	`	"It would only be a few weeks for us to have a number of prototype ships ready, but I highly suggest that we wait until we have created hull repair technology. If these Unfettered Solifuges do not have such technology, then having it will give our ship an advantage by being able to redeploy damaged drones, but we believe that we are still many years away from developing technology strong enough to be of any real use."`
	`	The elders once again mumble among themselves. They continue to ask Osen a number of questions about this new carrier. How difficult is one to produce? How much does it cost? What are the capabilities of the drones? How useful would it be without being able to repair the hull of its drones?`
	`	After having all their questions answered, the elders seem to be interested in the idea of Osen's new ship. "This hull repair technology indeed sounds necessary," an elder says. "We will provide what funding we can to help fast track its development."`
	`	Osen's father turns to you. "You have traveled many systems, &#60;first&#62; &#60;last&#62;. Perhaps you might be able to help. If you know of any peoples who have such technology from elsewhere in the galaxy, should it exist, then perhaps we could meet with them."`
