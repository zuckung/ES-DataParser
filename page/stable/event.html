The powerful holoprojection system, which once projected an "anomaly" into space to cover the wormhole, is now inactive. Now that the Hai are entering public relations with human governments, this station has come into its own. A wide concourse facilitates social and business exchanges, as well as parades and demonstrations. The two uppermost decks handle state functions and diplomatic services, including the now famed Borealis Chamber, formally referred to as "Where Mountains Touch The Sky," where the public acknowledgment of the Hai was first given, and where the two species committed a formal resolution to define a treaty of cooperation.`
		spaceport `The spaceport is a spacious docking assembly sheltered under broad, carapace-like structures which are arrayed around the lower decks like petals. It is designed to look impressive, and still has that shiny look and freshly oiled smell of a newly minted construction, though it has only basic facilities and services.`

The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.`

When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so.`
		description `	Until recently, Thule was a well-known den of pirate activity, but the major tribal authorities have now forsworn piracy in the interest of keeping the Free Worlds from further meddling in their affairs. However, it is likely that all manner of illegal activity is still going on in secret here.`
	planet "Smuggler's Den"
		description `Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. After that, it was taken over by pirates, and became a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. Now, at least in theory it is an independent station, no longer allied with the pirates. In practice, you suspect a fair amount of piracy still goes on here.`
		description `The repair shops here can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship, and in the shipyard you can buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners.`
		spaceport `It is a strange but indisputable fact that anarchists smell worse than ordinary human beings. In this day and age, where even the cheapest shuttlecraft at least has a sonic shower, there is no logical explanation for it, except that anarchist tendencies must somehow go hand in hand with a tendency to reject society's norms around hygiene. Here in a space station, with nothing but recycled air to breathe, the effect is overpowering.`

When rival pirate bands sought to negotiate on neutral territory, this is where they met. Nearly everything was for sale here: illegal weapons, ships customized for pirating, and even slaves.`
		description `	Now that the Free Worlds is occupying the system, Greenrock has become a marginally more respectable world. Pirates still run wild in the wilderness of the planet, but the Free Worlds is actively arresting criminals and freeing slaves in the population centers.`
		spaceport `You have heard enough about this port's reputation that you are not surprised to see the remnants of slave markets, now empty as a result of the Free Worlds occupation. The normally shady establishments are now filled with militia and the occasional merchant captain looking to explore the planet while it's still in Free Worlds hands.`
		spaceport `	Despite the Free Worlds presence, dark alleyways are still to be avoided. Down one alley you see a shop called "Mike's Mustelids," the inside overrun by weasels, ferrets, and wolverines that were once caged there.`

Nor are you shocked by the shady establishments catering to all manner of prurient interests. This is, after all, a pirate port, and everything is for sale here.`
		spaceport `	Everything, in fact, including the very bizarre. You find one dark alley that has been completely fenced off from the rest of the spaceport, the howls of animals coming from behind the barrier. Beside the alley you see a sign for a shop called "Mike's Mustelids," promising the sale of "exotic animals from within Greenrock's urban spaceport jungle."`

Its walls are covered with photographs from after the war: liberated slaves boarding Navy ships to leave this planet that had brought them so much pain; Navy officers leaving their ships to retire on this world that they liberated; friends gone away; friends left behind. There are newer pictures, too: a Cruiser and two Falcons, side by side; armored troops walking away from a factory; a familiar captain talking to a man you know as Commander Nguyen. It is a strange feeling to be shown among heroes of a history that you have had only the smallest effect on.`

		description `	Recently, with the help of the Free Worlds, a new spaceport was completed here. Bloodsea was formerly a pirate world, but the new spaceport has given it an air of respectability, and already a small number of settlers and curious tourists have begun flowing in.`
		spaceport `The new spaceport is impressively well designed, with seawalls and landing pads of crisp, newly-set concrete, still unmarked by weather or mildew. It is also several times larger than necessary for the number of people and ships that are here, and aside from a lively market, it feels strangely empty.`
		spaceport `	Some things remain unchanged from back in the pirate days. The local slang incorporates threats of extreme violence as a seemingly meaningless verbal tic. "Hey, I'm gonna cut off your fingers one by one until you buy a meat patty!" a vendor calls out cheerfully as you pass. "First one's free, and I'll tie a knot in your spine if you don't like it."`

		description `	The shattered remnants of the old Navy Yard are still left abandoned and slowly rusting away in the planet's caustic atmosphere, but the Republic has now built a new shipyard to replace the one destroyed in the bombing, and once again Geminus has become a central hub of technology and industry.`
		spaceport `Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled.`
		spaceport `	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon.`

		description `Martini is a world of exotic beaches and perfect weather. The Republic's central bank and the galactic stock exchange were previously headquartered here, before a terrorist attack destroyed them and a large portion of the old capital city as well.`
		description `	The new capital city is on the other side of the main continent, where lingering radiation will not affect the rest of the population. It is not so grand as the old capital, but its population has swelled from resettlement from the irradiated areas and it is quickly gaining the air of a major metropolis. The inhabitants, many of whom are survivors of the blast, have rallied behind a sort of 'will-do' attitude that only occurs after such a devastating and destructive event.`
		spaceport `Currently, the newly-designated planetary spaceport does not possess the infrastructure to act as the main spaceport of Martini. The expansive temporary spaceport from the relief operation is still being used, and since then, permanent landing pads have been built, but there are now plans to demolish it and give the new planetary spaceport a desperately needed expansion.`
		spaceport `	Martini's old spaceport still remains, as it was located just outside the blast zone and its deflector shields bore the brunt of the shockwave, but its towers partially collapsed in the days following the devastation. It now appears from a distance to be a few unevenly-levelled black spires rising before a backdrop of the smoke and remnants of a ruined city, no longer gleaming as it once did.`

Aside from the managers of the mining companies, nearly all the people here are migrant workers from elsewhere in the Dirt Belt, who have come to spend a season working for the relatively high wages that uranium mining offers, either to send money off-world or to save it up in order to build a better life for themselves.`
		description `	Due to the results of recent terraforming experiments, Rand has become a moderately more habitable place. Fascination with this change in climate has led to Rand becoming a semi-popular tourist destination of the Dirt Belt.`
	planet "Tundra"
		spaceport `The spaceport village consists of several large domes, which keep out the wind and driving snow; ships enter and exit the largest of the domes through a hatch that closes as soon as they have come through. Before the planet was terraformed, enough snow would pile up on top of one of the domes every decade or so that it became a danger of collapsing under its own weight; the locals would simply move out of that dome and build another one higher up on the snowpack, but the changing climate has reduced the amount of snow enough that the locals may never need to build another dome again.`

	planet Alix
		add description `	Here the Ka'het attacks were limited to the inhabited settlements; had they also destroyed the mining bases and the unmanned vessels, Parii'het would have run out of supplies thousands of years ago.`
	planet Celeatis
		add description `	This planet appears to have been home to one of the largest Builder research centers, which focused on studying the anomaly in the system. Had they found out how to stabilize it and use it as a wormhole, perhaps their species would have survived and spread to the rest of the Ember Waste.`
	planet Ceilia'sei
		add description `	The main purpose of Ceilia'sei was to act as some sort of anti-missile platform, but when the Ka'het invaded a second time, the station had no way to defend against their deadly Ravager Beams, and the station's defense systems were subsequently lost forever.`
	planet Eavine
		add description `	This moon was also home for the second Ka'het wave, which, same as the first, refused to obey their creators. It had been terraformed to make it a more appealing place to live, but after their civilization collapsed the moon began to return to its natural state. When it reverted to its original sub-zero temperatures, the facilities stopped working, and the Ka'het production in this site came to an end.`
	planet "Letis'sei"
		add description `	As it was designed to be crewed as minimally as possible, only a tiny fraction of Letis'sei station was inhabitable. The rest of the station was instead dedicated to advanced computing and targeting systems, most of which are still intact today.`
	planet Osaeli
		add description `	For most of the intervening millennia between the Builders' achievement of spaceflight and their extinction, Osaeli was the de facto capital of the Builders, a key part of their economy and society. The first Het station was constructed orbiting this planet's star with the purpose of protecting them from any external threat.`
	planet Palarei
		add description `	Thanks to their earlier exploration efforts, this was where the Builders encountered the first lifeforms that evolved outside their home planet. While the climate was drastically different from that of the Builders' homeworld, the fruits the local flora produced were popular enough for Palarei to become a major farming planet.`
	planet Parii'het
		add description `	Parii'het was almost finished when the invasion broke out, and already capable of creating Ka'het. Thanks to the mining on Alix and the occasional asteroid mine operated by the Mar drones, most of the facilities are still fully operational to this day.`
	planet Retilie
		add description `	As it was mainly used for fishing, the settlements on this planet were never as advanced as the ones on nearby worlds, so when the Ka'het arrived, there was basically nothing to stop them: after a few attacks, the planet was uninhabited again.`
	planet Seli'het
		add description `	This was the only Het station the Builders ever completed, orbiting Giribea. As the young Ka'heta reach their "Age of Assembly," strange, lanky machines start molding an exoskeleton onto their bodies right away. As the Ka'heta grow, their exoskeleton is expanded and various outfits are added, transforming them into living weapons.`
	planet Siteria
		add description `	This was the Builder homeworld; both the place where their journey began and where it ended. After a dozen millennia of underpopulation, the Ka'het arrival forced them to withdraw from the planet entirely. As one of the few remaining planets capable of sustaining farming, this was their last stronghold, falling centuries after the invasion begun.`
	planet Veliante
		add description `	Soon after the beginning the invasion, an attack on some sort of advanced nuclear facility started a meltdown; the fallout quickly spread across most of the planet, leaving all Builder settlements uninhabitable.`

The Wanderers, working together with the Kor Efreti, have founded a settlement here and begun working to accelerate the process of rejuvenating the wastelands.`

Since most of them do not speak each other's language, the two groups do not mingle much, and communicate mostly via gestures and drawings. It's not much, but it's at least a start for the two species to begin learning from each other.`

		description `The Wanderers worked for years to make this desert world bloom: planting hardy shrubs and cacti that eventually transform the sand into a soil that can hold moisture. In some regions, especially closer to the poles, the deserts have given way to dense forests, but near the equator there are still large stretches of dry and barren sand, broken by the occasional belt of green where a narrow river winds between the dunes.`
		description `	Now that the Unfettered have taken over control of the planet, it may be only a matter of time before the deserts dominate it once again.`
		spaceport `The spaceport is in a forest village near the planet's north pole. The landing pads are massive stone monoliths laid on the ground in a nearby clearing. But aside from a few large warehouses at ground level, the village itself is entirely made of tree-houses. Although they are very different from Hai architecture, the Unfettered seem to be quite at home living in the tree-houses, and have not built many of their own structures yet.`

		attributes "unfettered" "urban" "farming"
		description `Of all the worlds that the Unfettered have captured, this is surely the one that the Wanderers will miss the most: a heavily forested planet that was once home to countless small villages and even a few cities. The Unfettered are clearly doing their best to tend the farms here, but they operate on a permaculture system that relies heavily on maintaining a delicate ecological balance, rather than on machines and pesticides.`
		spaceport `A large number of Unfettered settlers have already arrived here and begun setting up a spaceport village, complete with markets, taverns, and military barracks. To the Unfettered, who have lived their whole lives on worlds where the local ecology is in shambles, this planet must seem like a paradise.`

		attributes "unfettered" "fishing"
		description `The surface of this world is almost entirely ocean. The Wanderer settlements were built on massive floating algae mats, some of them the size of a small city. Engines are attached to some of these floating villages, allowing them to be slowly propelled from one part of the planet's surface to another, and the only native industries are fishing and seaweed farming.`
		spaceport `The raft of algae that supports the spaceport is probably at least a dozen meters thick, but flexible enough that it bends as the ocean swells pass underneath, causing individual buildings to rise up or tilt slightly relative to their neighbors. Now that this world has been captured by the Unfettered, nearly all the buildings are empty; it appears that the Hai are not too fond of the idea of inhabiting a water world, so they are using it mostly as a military base.`

		description `Plumes of soot and ash rise from a cluster of several dozen volcanoes on this planet's main continent, shrouding the planet in a thick layer of clouds and choking out the sunlight. The ruins of several Korath cities and the geometric grids of cleared land surrounding them show that this was once a farming world, but now few plants are able to survive and kilometer-high glaciers have begun creeping down from the poles.`
		description `	With some help from the Mereti drones, the Wanderers have set up factories here that are pumping out carbon dioxide and methane to warm the atmosphere. In a few decades, the glaciers may start to recede.`
		spaceport `This odd settlement was built half by the Wanderers and half by the Mereti drones. The layout of the streets is completely chaotic, and they have planted rows of trees and bushes everywhere: some inside greenhouses, and some hardier species out in the open air. The settlement is near the equator, but it is still not particularly warm.`

		description `Over the past century, a cubic kilometer of this moon has been hollowed out and filled with corridors and cavernous rooms. There is a city of nearly a hundred thousand people whose lives have been focused on science since their ancestors were first brought here a hundred twenty years ago. Now humans, Hai, and even some Korath, live here working side-by-side. Once they were slaves to a succession of criminal organizations, and their story brought the Hai and humans to the brink of war. Fortunately, a resourceful pilot from New Boston averted catastrophe and freed Elenctic Commune.`
		spaceport `The spaceport is a distinct structure separate from the larger underground settlements. It has both hangar and ventilation access to the surface with a massive air processor that is the primary supply of breathable air to the population. This once allowed the city to be controlled by pirate groups despite being vastly outnumbered by those they ruled. A disused fighting ring, empty mounts for battle trophies, and bloody spikes that once held pirate victims are all still features baked into the construction. A thick access tunnel with supplementary corridors and vents leads downward from the spaceport to the main settlement. There is still extensive damage from the invasion, but the denizens are slowly cleaning it up.`
