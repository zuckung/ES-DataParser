	# Determines whether the "universal ramscoop" is active on all ships. This ramscoop
	# provides a very small amount of fuel to every ship regardless of whether they have
	# an actual ramscoop or not. The strength of this ramscoop is scaled with the distance
	# to the system center twice, meaning it falls off much more quickly than a normal ramscoop.
	# DEFAULT: true
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: false, true, 0, 1
	"universal ramscoop" true
	# An attempt to spawn a person ship happens on average every this many frames.
	# DEFAULT: 36000 frames (ten minutes)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any integer &#62;= 1
	"person spawn period" 36000
	# While an attempt to spawn a person ship is made on average every number of frames specified
	# above, a person ship may still not spawn. Each person ship has a "weight" associated with them
	# which determines their chance of spawning. The chance of any single person ship spawning is their
	# weight divided by the sum of the weights of all person ships and this value here. That means that
	# the chance of no person ship spawning is this number over the same sum.
	# DEFAULT: 1000
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any integer &#62;= 0
	"no person spawn weight" 1000
	# NPC ships with the mining personality will spend this many frames mining in the current system
	# before deciding to do something else. The purpose of this limit is so that NPC ships can be seen
	# by the player to show how to mine without also stripping the system bare of minable asteroids.
	# This limit does not apply to mining ships that are spawned by a mission.
	# DEFAULT: 3600 frames (one minute)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any integer &#62;= 0
	"npc max mining time" 3600
	# Ships with the "frugal" personality will only use weapons that consume ammo or fuel while their health is at or below this fraction.
	# DEFAULT: .75 (75 percent)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any value between 0. and 1.
	"universal frugal threshold" .75
