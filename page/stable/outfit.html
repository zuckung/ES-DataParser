Due to the size and power of these cannons, their shells have a slow reload time and travel speed. As such, they can often be dodged by faster or smaller craft, but if able to be equipped in numbers, they can create a deadly wall of fire.`

	description "The Unfettered conflict with the rest of the Hai has put pressure on them to gain a technological edge, despite their limited resources. The Ionic Blaster is a result of that pressure. It is much smaller than the venerable Ion Cannon, while also doing more raw damage for its size. It also is still able to apply some of the same energy draining effects, but Unfettered scientists have pushed it towards a higher relative focus on jamming enemy weapons."

	description `Decades after buying the rights for the Plasma Cannon, Kraz Cybernetics put this weapon on the shelves of every high-end outfitter of the Southern Rim. The repeater has so far proved immensely popular amongst any who braved testing it, and is shaping up to become an essential deterrent for anyone who flaunts their haul for pirate plunder.`
	description `	Derived from the original Plasma Cannon, this heavier version trades off its larger bursts for a much faster rate of fire. Although the smaller bursts of superheated plasma deal far less damage than its predecessor, the volume of fire results in more damage to the target overall.`

However, they are also much slower, because they are intended mostly for use against large and slow-moving capital ships. As a result, sufficiently skilled pilots can often dodge around them."

While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

	description "	These are the largest gravitoplasma thrusters that the Efreti have to offer, and as such are usually only found on their gargantuan civilian ships. Despite their size and thrusting power, the Quarg are still rather unimpressed with the inefficient nature of the design."

	description "	More stable than one would expect from Korath engines this large, these steering thrusters were developed by the Efreti as a means of guiding their most massive ships. Their high energy usage is tempered by the fact that they are usually powered by the most massive Korath fusion reactors."

	description "	Because the same property that allows the microbots through a target's shields disrupts the shields of the ship firing them, it should never be used without an appropriately large Systems Core. Given adequate shield generation, however, the microbots make fantastic miners."

	description `Nearly a century ago, a Remnant scout exploring space north of the Ember Waste came under fire from an alien fleet armed with weapons that interfered with the scout's engines. The story says that the Remnant captain calmly told her crew, "We aren't going home until we steal that weapon." That alien technology became the basis of the Inhibitor Cannon.`
	description `	Although the Remnant appreciated the original weapon, they were disappointed that it was too big to fit on most of their ships. Instead of letting their effort go to waste, they instead opted to put their newfound knowledge to use creating a weapon suitable for their more nimble craft. Thus, the Inhibitor is excellent at controlling engagement distances, keeping targets at range by both pushing them backward with the impact of each shot while also slowing their approach by interfering with their engines.`

	description `While cannons that can interfere with a ship's engines are useful in any situation, the Remnant quickly decided that it would be even more useful as a turret that their ships could use to impede those chasing after them. These small Inhibitor Turrets are typically found primarily on Pelicans trying to outrun opponents rather than defeat them.`
	description `Although these turrets are unremarkable in terms of performance, the comparatively recent perfection of a technique of installing the bulk of the weapon itself externally on the turret mount instead of under the base has resulted in a weapon that takes comparatively little outfit space. It does, however, still add quite a bit more to the mass of the ship.`

	description "The Ember Wastes are an anomalous region subject to forces that defy conventional physics: Energy spontaneously pouring from the vacuum, material density far greater than one would expect to find in space - even around a nebula, a concentration of wormholes unheard of in the galaxy, and regions where the universe itself seems to be in flux. This region, more than any building or ship, is the Remnant laboratory where they study the deepest workings of the universe."
	description "	When asked to clarify whether the name refers to either ripping or crying, the technician looks at you with a curious expression, and replies 'both.' They then go on to explain that a very simplistic explanation for this weapon is that it is making micro-tears in the fabric of space-time, then cauterizing them together again. Should not the Ember Wastes cry at the necessity of such weapons?"
	description "	These massive weapons require special hardpoints, and are built in such few number that the Remnant distribute them directly on an as-needed basis. Due to the prodigious energy and fuel requirements, only the most massive of Remnant ships can support regular use of these weapons."

For the rare captain braving the area in non-Remnant ships, this ramscoop is not particularly powerful, but it allows a ship to explore without fear of getting stranded.`

When the room isn't otherwise occupied, this module expands out to convert it into a fully fledged laboratory."
	description "	While planetbound scientists might consider it little more than a closet packed with scanners and equipment, to the Remnant it is a base of operations used to investigate alien and stellar phenomena on-site. For captains, having advanced equipment to support their sensor suites as well as a trained scientist to serve in their crew amount to a strong benefit."

Far more important is the ability for their ships to quickly and efficiently enter or exit combat as needed. At the end of the day, it is continued life that is paramount."
	description "	The Bellows-Class Afterburner embodies this philosophy by providing captains with a tool that allows them to make great leaps of acceleration, typically during evasive maneuvers or to catch up with a fleeing target. Due to their enormous fuel usage, only the most specialized of ships have enough fuel to use these for more than a few seconds at a time before completely running out of fuel."

	description "The Remnant made a significant number of these weapons during the early years of their research on the void sprites, but have not been able to make any new ones since the Archon stopped their harvests. Without a supply of new tentacles to use, the Remnant have been unable to manufacture more. While durable, they rarely last more than a decade, so even the best cared for of the old Void Rifles degraded into uselessness centuries ago. These highly effective weapons are credited with helping the Remnant safeguard their refuges from ground-based threats during their early years."
	description "	When fired, the Void Rifle emits a beam that has a strong paralyzing effect on the nervous system. With an area of effect that penetrates walls and other solid objects, it is an incredibly effective weapon."

The missiles are fired in volleys of six at a time from each launcher, making them very effective at overwhelming point defenses despite their fragility. However, the low amount of fuel they carry means they can only home in on the target for about a second before they turn into unguided ammunition. Because they are manufactured on the spot, it takes a long time to reload."
