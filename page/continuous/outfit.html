Now, even with faster-than-light travel available, ramscoops are just as critical as before, allowing the Avgi to ply the hyperlanes between the many systems where no fuel depots have been built."
	description "	A powerful bank of lasers ionizes the interstellar medium around ships equipped with these ramscoops, allowing a Magnetic Scoop to collect extra material on top of the naturally charged solar wind. This results in a more predictable supply of fuel, even around stars with solar winds poor in deuterium. Of course, the power the lasers require can be quite considerable, as is the heat produced from compressing the incident plasma."

	description "A plasma magnet gives this ramscoop an unparalleled collection area, allowing it to gather incredible amounts of fuel. By driving an oscillating, out-of-phase current through a pair of coils perpendicular to the passing solar wind, a magnetic field can be introduced to the rarefied plasma that permeates space. This field itself drags free electrons in the plasma in a circular path, inducing a current in an enormous virtual loop that itself generates a proportionally larger quasi-static magnetic field - one that is hundreds of kilometers in diameter in the case of the Plasmadyne Scoop."
	description "	This magnetic field spans a range far larger than what can be generated by any physical loop of wire of reasonable size, while also sparing a starship from carrying an enormous mass of superconducting wire. It does require a rather large amount of power to function, however, and the interaction with the plasma of the interplanetary medium causes a significant amount of drag."

	description "	Unfortunately, for its size, you would expect this shield generator to be far more powerful than it actually is. While it is nearly as large as the heaviest human shield generators, it is only about half as strong, while also consuming far more power. Much of this power ends up being shed as waste heat instead of being used to efficiently regenerate a shield, resulting in a generator that can be generously described as anemic."

An annular flow surrounding the pinch keeps it stable, confining the plasma long enough for nearly all of the fuel to be burned by the time it makes its way down the length of the engine and out the magnetic nozzle on its rear. Without the need for fragile, heavy magnets or bulky lasers to ignite and confine the fusion reaction, the resulting drive is incredibly efficient and compact, which has made it the mainstay of Avgi spacecraft propulsion for centuries."

	description "The largest and oldest of the common fusion torches used by the Avgi, the Arc is derived from an interstellar-class design that was modified and downrated to make it more suitable for interplanetary operations by trading specific impulse for raw thrust. At this scale, the pinch is long enough that it is able to confine the plasma for sufficient time to not only fuse the deuterium into a mix of helium-3 and tritium, but to likewise burn the aforementioned fusion products together with leftover deuterium to release even more energy. This reaction, known as catalyzed D-D fusion, gives the Arc superior fuel efficiency over its smaller cousins."
	description "	The magnetic nozzle is designed to support a variety of components that can be slotted in to provide various effects, from injecting additional propellant to improve thrust to tapping energy from the expanding fusion plasma to power a ship's systems."

	description "A powerful magnetohydrodynamic turbopump forces a torrent of lithium-seeded water into the throat of a fusion torch's magnetic nozzle, dramatically increasing thrust at the cost of a significant increase in propellant consumption. The additional mass flow likewise reduces the waste heat generated by a torch drive, capturing much of it as propellant is injected around the fusion reaction."

This removes some energy from the exhaust plume and reduces its produced thrust, but the liberated energy is great enough that this is the primary means by which high performance Avgi starships generate power."

These thrusters allow Avgi starships to easily dock with stations or other ships without igniting their highly radioactive fusion torches."

	description "The fastest Avgi starships were propelled not just by their engines, but also by immense banks of lasers and particle beams stationed in the Anax system, pushing ships to velocities in excess of 0.2c before braking with a magsail or plasma magnet. Just before the invention of the hyperdrive, however, the Avgi perfected this beam-core antimatter drive, capable of pushing a starship with sufficient antimatter fuel to 0.4c and perhaps beyond. Requiring immense quantities of antimatter, the amat farms around Anax such as Antivli Station would have been strained to their limits had this design entered mass production, but the surprise invention of the hyperdrive rendered it laughably obsolete overnight."

	description "This slim laser rifle can be tuned to produce a beam across a wide spectrum of settings, resulting in a versatile small arm suitable for both ground combat and boarding operations. A solid-state emitter works anywhere between the near-infrared to blue-green, and with a wide range of power and pulse length settings. While the low end of the near-infrared range is nominally eye-safe, even a diffuse reflection of the visible light beam can cause instant blindness, so users of this rifle must wear specialized goggles that darken when exposed to bright light. Incidentally, this makes the Optical Laser Rifle especially dangerous for unprepared foes, such as unwelcome intruders or enemy boarding parties."
	description "	Both the aiming scope and laser aperture share the same focusing mirror, eliminating scope parallax and allowing auto-focusing optics to easily aim the beam at anything the user can see in the scope."

	description "This lightweight turret can be fed a beam of light from a lasing generator, which is then combined and focused to produce an intense beam ideal for damaging other ships. By pulsing thousands of times each second, the beam can create thermal and mechanical shocks in the target material, enhancing its ability to drill through armor. Unlike the advanced beam weapons used by some other species, this laser is subject to the effects of diffraction, causing its damage to become less intense with distance while also rendering it invisible. However, precise optics allow the beam to be targeted from an exceptional range, despite the tenuous damage at the edge of the laser's reach."

Little more than a payload of tungsten rods, an octaazacubane thruster package, and a nose mounted sensor array, they can be manufactured in bulk at minimal cost. Upon closing in on a target, the missile unwraps into dozens of thin tungsten rods to create a cone-shaped area of effect. While only a fraction of the payload actually impacts a target, the cloud of projectiles is difficult to completely eliminate."

	description "Unlike humanity, the Avgi do not have a strong taboo against the use of nuclear weapons in space. To them, nuclear weapons are simply another tool, albeit one with a particularly high energy density, to be used when the occasion calls for it. They have been the Avgi's trump card against the Aberrant, the one weapon they have capable of reliably breaking their advanced shields and atomizing their armor."
	description "	This particular missile carries a powerful thermonuclear warhead, a staged device with a far higher yield to weight ratio than anything humanity has developed. It seems to be the product of centuries of development of nuclear devices, as opposed to humanity's long abstention from nuclear weapons research."

This argument started with the third Civil Goods and Fares Act, created just a few decades after the War of Independence. It has continued all the way to the relatively recent twenty-sixth addendum to the second article of the Ninth Rectification on Commerce and Traffic, passed two hundred years ago, which made the acquisition requirements much more flexible."

	description `This is a ceremonial spear-like weapon presented to Vi warriors when they officially become part of the military. On the forward end are several long, sharp pikes that can easily pierce enemies, and on the rear end is a built-in cannon that can fire up to two explosive rounds. The cannon rounds are rarely used by the Vi unless they deem it absolutely necessary to defeat their foe or deal with unanticipated outside factors.`

Despite this, the hard-armored hulls of larger Gegno warships prove resilient enough to field Irate Carronades. Anyone, or anything, that unknowingly approaches a corridor where one is installed will likely become a new paint layer on the nearby walls.`

Additionally, the single shared housing results in a less consistent firing pattern, limiting it to bursts. These factors have made the Tripulse Shredder a popular hit-and-run weapon among the Unfettered."

	description "A shield regenerator works by subtly modifying the geometry of your shield matrix in order to make your shields more malleable and therefore much easier to recharge. Unfortunately, this causes your shields to also become less efficient, which draws energy away from your other systems, even when not charging shields, and creates heat."

	description "In the early days of space exploration, when ships could travel through half a dozen systems before encountering an established colony where they could refuel, ramscoops were an essential piece of equipment, harvesting plasma from the solar wind to refill your hyperspace fuel tanks. Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first."
	description "	Different kinds of stars will generate varying levels of fuel in the solar wind, but in all cases the closer you are to the star, the faster fuel will accumulate. As a safety measure, all ships are able to harvest tiny amounts of fuel by flying close to a star, but this outfit allows you to accumulate fuel much more quickly."

	description "For much of the Republic's nearly three century long history, being able to pilot your own starship was limited only by your ability to purchase one. But at the turn of the millennium in an attempt to increase tax revenue, the Republic Parliament passed a law requiring that all ship captains purchase a pilot's license, and for no small fee at that. Needless to say, this policy is not terribly popular with freelance merchant captains."

Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blaster Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

	description `Decades after buying the rights for the Plasma Cannon, Kraz Cybernetics put this weapon on the shelves of every high-end outfitter of the Southern Rim. The repeater has so far proved immensely popular amongst any who braved testing it, and is shaping up to become an essential deterrent for anyone who flaunts their haul for pirate plunder.`
	description `	Derived from the original Plasma Cannon, this heavier version trades off its larger bursts for a much faster rate of fire. Although the smaller bursts of superheated plasma deal far less damage than its predecessor, the volume of fire results in more damage to the target overall.`

Over a millennium later, this modern incarnation of the Gatling Gun sees action in the stars, a testament to its fundamentally robust design - and Dr. Gatling's naivete. While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

	description "The Stagnation Beam is one of the few technologies of the Incipias that surpasses anything humanity has made thus far - in fact, the first prototypes were built before the Incipias even dreamed of space travel. The weapon's origins lie in giant reactors that were constructed to pull asteroids out of their home planet's orbit, providing easy access to more resources. Naturally, a mechanism to slow the asteroids down was also implemented to prevent accidental asteroid strikes."
	description "	As the Incipias' mastery of spaceflight grew, so did the generators' efficiency, which allowed for more compact, ship-based tractor beams. Resource collection was greatly streamlined by these new models, much to the benefit of the Incipias' otherwise sluggish ships."
	description "	The secret of how these beams work is only known to a few scientists of the Incipias who are under the control of the state. Such knowledge, if made public, could have disastrous consequences for the Hicemus and their grip on power."

	description "Hydrogen energy storage was discovered early by the Incipias because of the great amount of metallic hydrogen on their homeworld. Because Incipias ships usually access their energy at the time it is produced, only a small amount of storage is needed. Most of their ships have only one cell installed as a consequence."

	description "Most drones the Builders possessed were completely unarmed, making them very vulnerable to enemy attacks. Since installing weapons would have greatly reduced its cargo capacity, they instead decided to dissuade possible hijackers by developing these Emergency Deployers: they work by activating a series of reactions inside the ship's MHD generator and then ejecting it towards the enemy, resulting in a large scale detonation as soon as it hits something."

	description "Efreti engineers have begun to grudgingly take inspiration from their not-entirely-welcome Quarg guardians. The incorporation of gravitational propulsion increases the thrust output for engines in this line, at the cost of even higher energy use. These are the smallest such gravitoplasma-based thrusters."

	description "According to little more than vague allusions by the Quarg, these generators contain a minuscule black hole, spewing radiation as it is fed a trickle of mass. This black hole is small enough to output a truly staggering amount of energy via Hawking radiation, which grows in power as a black hole shrinks, something that suggests the black hole within the Singularity Core is truly microscopic."
	description "	Further wild guesses by scientists and conspiracy theorists alike allege that the Quarg are able to somehow trick the laws of physics themselves to make this black hole weigh far less than it otherwise should, bringing its mass from that of a small moon to something a ship could have a hope of moving."

	description "This larger generator appears similar to the Singularity Core, only even more powerful. Little is known about its exact function, but purely based on its name, some have speculated that the Quasar Core's increased output is the result of the black hole at its core being fed enough mass to form a small accretion disk, releasing light and heat as it falls towards the event horizon and is compressed to an unimaginable degree."
	description "	While this process should be far less fuel-efficient than simply capturing the Hawking radiation emitted by the black hole alone, the staggering power density of this generator appears to be evidence it was worth the trade."

	description `Nearly a century ago, a Remnant scout exploring space north of the Ember Waste came under fire from an alien fleet armed with weapons that interfered with the scout's engines. The story says that the Remnant captain calmly told her crew, "We aren't going home until we steal that weapon." That alien technology became the basis of the Inhibitor Cannon.`
	description `	Although the Remnant appreciated the original weapon, they were disappointed that it was too big to fit on most of their ships. Instead of letting their effort go to waste, they instead opted to put their newfound knowledge to use creating a weapon suitable for their more nimble craft. Thus, the Inhibitor is excellent at controlling engagement distances, keeping targets at range by both pushing them backward with the impact of each shot while also slowing their approach by interfering with their engines.`

	description `While cannons that can interfere with a ship's engines are useful in any situation, the Remnant quickly decided that it would be even more useful as a turret that their ships could use to impede those chasing after them. These small Inhibitor Turrets are typically found primarily on Pelicans trying to outrun opponents rather than defeat them.`
	description `Although these turrets are unremarkable in terms of performance, the comparatively recent perfection of a technique of installing the bulk of the weapon itself externally on the turret mount instead of under the base has resulted in a weapon that takes comparatively little outfit space. It does, however, still add quite a bit more to the mass of the ship.`

	description "The Ember Wastes are an anomalous region subject to forces that defy conventional physics: Energy spontaneously pouring from the vacuum, material density far greater than one would expect to find in space - even around a nebula, a concentration of wormholes unheard of in the galaxy, and regions where the universe itself seems to be in flux. This region, more than any building or ship, is the Remnant laboratory where they study the deepest workings of the universe."
	description "	When asked to clarify whether the name refers to either ripping or crying, the technician looks at you with a curious expression, and replies 'both.' They then go on to explain that a very simplistic explanation for this weapon is that it is making micro-tears in the fabric of space-time, then cauterizing them together again. Should not the Ember Wastes cry at the necessity of such weapons?"
	description "	These massive weapons require special hardpoints, and are built in such few number that the Remnant distribute them directly on an as-needed basis. Due to the prodigious energy and fuel requirements, only the most massive of Remnant ships can support regular use of these weapons."

Far more important is the ability for their ships to quickly and efficiently enter or exit combat as needed. At the end of the day, it is continued life that is paramount."
	description "	The Bellows-Class Afterburner embodies this philosophy by providing captains with a tool that allows them to make great leaps of acceleration, typically during evasive maneuvers or to catch up with a fleeing target.

Without a supply of new tentacles to use, the Remnant have been unable to manufacture more. While durable, they rarely last more than a decade, so even the best cared for of the old Void Rifles degraded into uselessness centuries ago. These highly effective weapons are credited with helping the Remnant safeguard their refuges from ground-based threats during their early years."

These include a hyperdrive, an enormous fusion reactor, and the most powerful plasma engines you've ever seen. It's all examples of relatively simple technology, but they have been refined and taken to their extreme. The engines are fundamentally connected to the fusion reactor, increasing their thrust even further and thereby allowing the Emerald Sword to fly at impressive speeds, traveling through interstellar space with relative ease."

	description "This ancient Sheragi turret accelerates a dense packet of electrons that, while very ineffective against any kind of shielding, has a very long range and disrupts electrical systems. By the nature of these weapons, one can deduce that their tactics likely involved using the Dragonflame Cannon at long range to break the enemy shields and finishing them off at relatively close range with the Particle Waveform Turrets."

	description "To reduce reliance on supply chains during prolonged war time, this outfit contains specialized fabricators that produce simple kinetic missiles from stock materials and a small amount of stored fuel; their guidance system merely receives data from the shipboard radar. The missiles are fired in volleys of six at a time from each launcher, making them very effective at overwhelming point defenses despite their fragility. However, the low amount of fuel they carry means they can only home in on the target for about a second before they turn into unguided ammunition. Because they are manufactured on the spot, it takes a long time to reload."

	description `Precise and deadly, the Ojet Bimodal Coilgun has been the High Houses' armament of choice since long before humans ever took to the stars. It was designed quite simply as a perfect weapon; it is said that by the time the empire of the Predecessors fell, they had seen no need to install any other weapon on their ships for over a thousand years.`
	description `	The Ojet fires hyperdense packets of charged particles that disperse as they travel: up close the concentrated bolt pierces armor, while at a distance the ionic spray destabilizes shielding. Together, a ship equipped with these weapons can adjust its damage profile just by changing its engagement range, allowing it to be highly effective against any foe.`

	description "The introduction of the Pulse Laser was a wake-up call for the more astute in the High Houses, as it was the first time in hundreds of years that weapons were being manufactured by groups other than themselves. Most Successors see the turreted version as a continuation of this democratization of violence, while the more paranoid claim that the High Houses have infiltrated production and intentionally sabotaged the design."

	description `Unable to access large quantities of the high-quality weaponry produced by the High Houses, the People's Houses have had to work with what is available to them: mostly the relatively low-powered pulse lasers produced independently in Successor space. This pulse laser has had its safeties bypassed and its optics upgraded, allowing it to do more damage to shields at a lower power cost in exchange for producing substantially more heat.`

	description "This oddly shaped dish holds a collection of perfectly preserved seeds of one Sentinel Skirtgrass, a sensitive yet robust species the Wanderers use during their initial terraforming efforts to gauge how well a world is responding to their methods. Each seed carries a built-in generational limit, ensuring the grass disappears after a few lifecycles so that it doesn't compete with native flora. These seeds symbolize the beginning of both terraforming and goodwill, granting their owner the right to acquire Wanderer outfits."

	description "Intact within an amber shell, this leafy branch of the Noble Watchwood - rumored to come from the Wanderers' original home planet - symbolizes their pride and joy, the total revitalization of a planet. While unmatched in size and formidable to behold, the tree is quite fragile to even the slightest alterations in climate, so the growth of one such specimen to maturity is seen as a sign of a healed ecosystem. As a symbol of peace akin to Earth's olive branch, it grants its bearer the right to purchase non-military Wanderer ships."

	description "The history of the Wanderers is not without hardship and failure. Immortalized in a bronze mold, this withered branch recalls the time the Wanderers could not save a world, for skilled as they may be, they cannot stop destruction when it is actively sought after by others mightier than them. The fall of the Noble Watchwood, their cherished emblem, now stands as a solemn vow: when peace fails, they too must prepare to fight. To stand and fight with the Wanderers, this license grants access to their greatest warships."
