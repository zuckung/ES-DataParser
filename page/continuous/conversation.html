A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`

The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2,503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 433,567 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`

	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

	`The train from your hometown rocks side-to-side at a steady rhythm, bringing you ever closer to the capital. Several seats forward, a young couple close to your age eagerly discuss their move to a new apartment as their legs kick their luggage. Behind you, a much older man in greasy overalls exchanges farewells with an acquaintance.`
	`	Before long, you arrive in New Reykjavik at the government office responsible for handling starship loans. The reception is buzzing with activity as other fresh-faced graduates chat among themselves while waiting for their turn. Sunlight falls through the slitted ceiling windows onto a three-dimensional representation of the Deep's insignia in the lobby's center, a red tree with branches forming the shape of a brain. A circle of text surrounds the sculpture, proclaiming the Deep's core values: Peace. Prosperity. Progress.`
	`	Eventually your number is called, and after reading over your application the office worker hands you two cards. One of them is your Certificate of Eligibility for a low-interest loan at a nearby bank. The other is your pilot's license, fully paid for. Your ticket to the stars.`
	`	You insert the card into an automatic clerk at the bank, and after a soft ping, a large document fills its screen. A synthesized voice says, "You are borrowing 680,000 credits to be repaid over the course of a year. Your daily interest rate is 0.2%, which means that your daily payments are 2,627 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid 278,760 credits in interest. Please sign your name on the screen when you are ready."`

	`	You rush out of the bank and hop on the metro towards the shipyard. As the rest of the carriage look blankly out the windows and at their devices, you are barely able to keep a straight face, flipping over your pilot's license at least a hundred times before the ride is over. You consider throwing away your transport pass as soon as you get off, but change your mind at the last minute. There won't be much else tying you to this planet soon.`
	`	You had pored over footage of New Reykjavik's shipyard in your younger days, but seeing the place in-person blows your wildest expectations out of the water. Salespeople use holographic displays to showcase a variety of vessels to sharply-dressed clients while skyscraper-sized ships loom silently in the shadows of the yard, waiting for the wealthiest of merchants to claim them. Although most of the ships are far outside of your price range, you spot four models that you'll be able to purchase. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

"Just a heads up: if you don't feel like dying early, head north after launching. South of here is nothing but uninhabited systems and pirates. You wouldn't last long in any ship you could afford." You thank her for the ride and advice before parting ways.`

You ask him what it would take to purchase a ship here. He mentions the necessity of a pilot's license before beginning his spiel about all the cheapest models, but you cut him short and say that's all you needed.`
	`	Luckily, the bank isn't very busy at the moment. One of the tellers sizes you up as you enter. "What can we help you with?" he asks with unrestrained glee. You say you're in need of a loan to buy a starship; 600,000 credits should be enough to cover the license and the ship. After you hand over your Syndicated Systems Account information and scan your fingerprint, the teller returns with a piece of paper.`

If you don't pay off any of your loan early, you'll have paid 706,571 credits in interest, more than the 600,000 loan itself. "Just sign here." The teller grins.`

	`	You return to the shipyard, this time with a credit chip in your hand to draw the attention of the salesman. "Welcome back! I hope we can find you the perfect model," he says. The shipyard is full of ships that you can't buy, but the salesman finds three models within your price range: an interceptor, a light freighter, and a transport ship. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

The other Hai quickly bows before dashing towards one of the landed ships.`
	`	"I'm selling off my fleet before retiring," the Hai says. "Sure, I could just go to the shipyard, but I could never have started if it weren't for another retiring captain selling me a ship for cheap when I was young. So, I've decided to pay it forward and help out other captains-to-be."`

"They really went into depth on some aspects of the Coalition's languages. None of the major plot points were changed, thankfully, though some content in the book had to be edited or removed. My Heliarch friend said that if I changed this or removed that, the book would sell so much better, and as they said, they wanted to 'make it more suitable for the Coalition.' Their words.`
	`	"As for the special copy, it was so I could verify and look at the changes they made, in my language, so I wouldn't have to learn their language. They agreed to print another copy for me so I could give it to you."`
	`	Anna checks a wristwatch that she didn't have when you first met. "Wow, it looks like people have already started reviewing the book, and they're giving great feedback! I've got to go now; I want to see in person how well my book is selling. Goodbye!"`

Though there are few here at present, many more of our number can be found out amongst the surging seas." He glances at the growing number of Skadenga. "If you follow me, I will escort you to our village and show you what buildings you may use. Though I fear we can not house so many."`

She and many others then follow Aldfrith and his group to the halls of Hrithfjall.`

	`You land at the Republic Navy Yard on Geminus escorting the two Dreadnoughts that are the Free Worlds contribution to the war against the Pug. You are met by the shipyard supervisor and a team of engineers who are preparing the Navy ships to join you. "So, these are your Dreadnoughts," one of them says. "I'm glad to finally have the chance to see one up close. I don't suppose one of the captains would be willing to give me a tour."`

	label yes
	`	The supervisor seems irked that his engineers are more interested in exploring nifty new ship technology than in the task at hand, but he grudgingly offers to give you a tour of the Navy Yard in exchange for letting his engineers take a closer look at the Dreadnoughts. Freya whispers to you, "Just think of this as another step toward peace and reconciliation."`
	`	The new shipyard is some distance away from the old one, which is still in ruins, a radioactive crater a few kilometers away from the spaceport. "The attack happened at night," says the supervisor. "Three hundred and forty-seven people were killed. If the attack had been during working hours, that number would have been in the thousands. We're recovering some metal from the old shipyard, but other than that it's a total loss. The radiation is slowly dying down, though."`
	`	There is deep anger in his voice as he speaks. You are glad that the Free Worlds have been proved innocent of involvement in the attack, but you suspect that on the worlds that were bombed, most people will not accept peace with the Syndicate on any terms except the full surrender of all the Syndicate personnel who were responsible.`
	`	When they're done giving you the tour, you return to the spaceport. The supervisor and the team of engineers wish you the best of luck, and depart.`

Big ships will usually ward off these effects much longer than a smaller ship would, but that's always been a notable issue with the original design.

But as you work deeper into its nested walls you begin to see signs of much more recent life.`

He said all they needed was a little convincing, and that he would come back with the support to terraform, and save, Hope. And then... he never came back."`
	`	Ildico sighs. "A treasure hunter killed my brother a few years back. My mother... she is also dead, and I am starving. I have no way to contact anyone else, and no one else is left.`

If you want to optimize your mining operations, however, you'll want a Mining Laser. Not only does it cut through asteroids faster, it's also more precise and preserves more minerals when the asteroid breaks apart. Some miners like to have a bit of combat flexibility by mining with Heavy Lasers, however.`
	`	"Aside from lasers, the most valuable tool is an asteroid scanner. They're expensive, but they connect into your navigation and targeting systems to point you towards minable asteroids. You can also set them to find the most valuable asteroids, which increases your profitability per run. After that, a tactical scanner will tell you how far away the asteroid is and show how much damage you're doing. An afterburner is good for chasing down fast moving asteroids or getting away from pirates without leaving the system. A ramscoop will let you refuel while mining, extend your exploration range, and allow you to be ready for a quick escape."`

	`A large crowd quickly gathers around your landing pad, eagerly awaiting your arrival. After all this time between the stars, setting foot on a planet with an actual atmosphere is incredibly refreshing. Ignoring the cold weather for a moment, you take the biggest breath you can to make up for the past weeks of recycled air.`
	`	Before you've even reached the end of the ramp, the people on the ground are already signing questions to you and the rest of the team about your journey. You do your best to reply, but in the overall mix of confusion and excitement you aren't sure anyone understood what you just said.`
	`	Between the chaos, you hear a familiar voice singing your name: a few meters on your left, you notice Chilia with his arm raised and a large grin greeting you back. Moving across the crowd not without some difficulty, you follow him through a narrow door inside a cramped room right next to the pad.`
	`	"I prefer this spaceport when it is more hushed," he remarks with a sigh, "but after the past weeks some frenzy is understandable. We will have to make do with this warehouse for now." He invites you to take a seat. "So, &#60;first&#62;, would you tell me about your journey?"`
	`	By the time you're done, more than an hour must have passed. Chilia paces aimlessly around the room, reflecting on your recounting of the events. As silence falls, you notice that calm seems to have returned on the pad as well.`

			goto wait
		`	"Do you know how we came back to this galaxy?"`
		`	"What happened while we were gone?"`
	`	"Oh. I thought you had been told already." He sits down in front of you. "It was us that brought Patir back here. After your departure, it did not take long for our long-range sensors to pick up that the black hole had disappeared, along with you and the team. Our data was scarce, but we knew one, very important thing: if Patir had appeared here once, there must have been a way to do that again.`
		goto explain
	label wait
	`	"If your description is accurate, it means Patir is not another mouth to a pocket universe, but instead a transporter to another galaxy. Or universe, for all we know. In retrospect, there were enough reasons to doubt that first theory, but we were far too busy trying to save you to look into it seriously." Seeing your confused expression, he continues. "&#60;first&#62;, it was us who brought Patir back here.`
	label explain
	`	"We knew Postverta was involved with Patir's initial arrival, and together with the team there, we discovered that the energy burst that had been released when Ssil Vida first appeared had no relation to the systems controlling its pocket universe. So, its activation or deactivation would have no effect on Patir, and we had to start looking somewhere else.`
	`	"Our research up to this point had mostly focused on the pocket universe; most of Postverta is still obscure to us. As we evaluated our options, we determined that, by the time we could understand the station's systems enough to use them for our purposes, your crew would have already run out of supplies and perished. Instead, we attempted to replicate the energy burst using just our technology, augmented by the transmission systems of Ssil Vida.`
	`	"The project took most of our workforce, as well as several weeks to complete, no thanks to a number of setbacks almost making us start over from scratch. But with the full power of the onboard reactors and an array of calculators rivaling that of our largest outposts, its giant antennae came back to life, and released a wave as strong as when Ssil Vida appeared. Two weeks later, Patir returned, and now you are here, safe and sound."`
	`	Finally, a tired Dusk reaches the two of you in the storage room, sitting down after greeting Chilia and you. From a brief exchange between them, you infer that he has also been told of the circumstances around your return.`

		`	"What is going to happen to Patir now?"`
			goto patir
		`	"Wait, what if we were not around Patir when it came back?"`
	`	"The black hole would have departed without us, and we would have been still stuck in that sector - only this time without a laboratory to support us, nor most of our consumables. The people down here perhaps could have been able to send Patir back there to pick us up, but by then we would have run out of supplies long before, and perished between the stars. We were lucky that things went the way they did, all things considered. Our research in those systems was supposed to bring us back, and yet we were just chasing rainbows, endangering ourselves further every step we took.`
		goto next
	label patir
	`	"It is difficult to say. Given what we have observed, it will probably disappear once again after the effects of our energy burst; when that will happen or where it will go is beyond our current knowledge. Those same systems we were stuck in could now be inaccessible, and our data might be the only information we will ever gather on them.`
	label next
	`	"At this point in time, exploring Patir would be a gamble, and an extremely risky one at that. The next phase will have to be operated from a distance, in order to fully understand the way that system works and how Ssil Vida controls it. How much time that will take, I cannot say; maybe weeks, or months, or even years. But then, and only then, will we go back there and start digging deeper."`
	choice
		`	"I understand."`
			goto finish
		`	"You want to return there?!"`
	`	Dusk smiles. "It is my job, after all. The danger of the unknown is always a part of it, even in the simplest of missions. I do admit the risk in these past weeks was far beyond an acceptable level, but one day, we will know enough about the mess in which we have become tangled in to unravel it."`
	label finish
	`	The two of them accompany you to the &#60;ship&#62;, sitting alone in the now-quiet spaceport of &#60;planet&#62;. The cargo bay has been emptied of the vast array of instruments that had been lying in it for a while, and you guess the same has been done with the cockpit. As you walk once again up the stairway, the Remnant bid you farewell. "We have transferred &#60;payment&#62; as a way to express our gratitude," Dusk signs with a smile. "Of course, their worth is incomparable with the value of what you have done for us; without you, we would have never made it out alive. Goodbye for now, and may the Embers aid in your pursuits."`

	`As you step out into the icy chill of Viminal, you get a message from Taely, the engineering prefect, asking if you could meet her in the cafeteria.`
	choice
		`	(Accept her invitation.)`
		`	(Not right now.)`
			defer
	`	Replying that you can, you make your way through the crowds and find an empty table. Moments later Taely appears and grabs two trays from the dispenser before heading towards you. She settles down in the opposite chair with a look of exhaustion.`
	`	"It is good to see you again, &#60;first&#62;," she sings softly. When you sign a reply she sits up, smiles, and switches to sign. "My, you are a quick learner. This is much faster." Her quick gestures are hard to follow, but the language videos seem to have focused on a practical vocabulary that has most of the words she uses.`
	`	"I have not fully..." (She makes a sign that you don't understand, but seems similar to the signs for "break" and "understand.") "... the technology you retrieved for us, but we are learning much from what we have already found. Could you help us catch up with what has happened in ancestral space since our Exodus?"`
	choice
		`	"Yes. What can I do to help?"`
		`	"Sorry, not interested."`
			decline

	`	"Excellent! According to a friend of mine who is versed in history from the war, there were rumors that a grand library was being built in the Deep to house all of human knowledge. If it exists, that would likely be where to go."`

	`	"Excellent! According to a friend of mine who is versed in history from the war, there were rumors that a grand library was being built in the Deep to house all of human knowledge. If it exists..." She stops when she notices you nodding with a knowing expression. "You have already been there? Well, you certainly get around, Captain &#60;last&#62;. I suppose that makes things rather straightforward."`
	`	"I actually already have a copy of the library's data in my ship," you respond.`
	`	"Oh, that's even better," Taely trills. "Go ahead and get it."`
	`	You return to your ship to get the data chip, but when you glance out the cockpit you notice that the spaceport is more animated than usual. Remnant look to be running to their ships as fast as they can when you notice that Taely is halfway up the side of your ship securing a refueling hose and charging cable. As you reach for the commlink she scrambles up to the bridge windows and quickly rattles off a series of signs at you. All you can make out is "Keep it hot, incoming!" Before you can frame a reply she has raced across your wing and leapt to the Albatross parked next to you.`
		goto launch
	label return
	`Having acquired a copy of the archive, you gently set your ship down on Viminal hoping that this information is helpful. The port seems unusually busy, but the comm channels are quiet beyond the bare minimum to keep traffic organized.`
	`	Before you have even taken the time to shut down the engines Taely is halfway up the side of your ship securing a refueling hose and charging cable. As you reach for the commlink she scrambles up to the bridge windows and quickly rattles off a series of signs at you. All you can make out is "Keep it hot, incoming!" Before you can frame a reply she has raced across your wing and leapt to the Albatross parked next to you.`
	label launch
	`	Looking around more carefully, you note that every ship in the port is idling with fuel lines still connected. If this were some Republic port the safety inspectors would be having a nightmare. One Starling is getting holes in its wings patched even as the crew appear to be running prep-for-flight checklists. It also looks like every ship has a guard. Something tells you that right now would be a bad time to take a walk around town.`
	`	After some tense minutes of waiting, the planetary defense sirens start and the idling ships begin to ascend one by one. You quickly figure out where you are in the launch sequence and follow the stream of craft heading for orbit.`

	`You land on &#60;origin&#62; and seek out the technologist that Sayari told you to contact: a Hai named Eruk. His eyes light up when you describe what you need from him, and why. "Contact with a new species! How very exciting," he says. "I am glad for Sayari that such an opportunity has been presented to her. But our speaking machines are very valuable. Before I give one to you, will you do a small favor for me?"`
	choice
		`	"Of course. What do you need?"`
			goto need
		`	"Can't I just pay you for one?"`
			goto money
	label need
	`	He says, "The human immigrants tell me that in the region of your space they call the Deep is a space station, a library that houses human cultural artifacts and a database of human literature and history. Bring me a copy of that database, and I will give you a speaking machine."`
		goto end
	label money
	`	"Money?" he says, with a dismissive gesture. "What use is money? No, from you I desire something far more valuable. The human immigrants tell me that in the region of your space they call the Deep is a space station, a library that houses human cultural artifacts and a database of human literature and history. Bring me a copy of that database, and I will give you a speaking machine."`
		goto end

		has "human cultural data"
	choice
		`	"No problem, I'll bring you a copy of the database as soon as I can."`
			accept
		`	"How will I convince them to give me a copy of their data?"`
	`	Your question seems to utterly confuse him. "Information," he says. "It is what you call a non-rival good, is it not? When I give information, I do not lose it. Sharing it costs me nothing. The librarians, surely they will understand this. Have no fear."`
		accept
	label data
	choice
		`	"I actually already have a copy of that data."`
	`	"You do? Please go get it!" he exclaims.`
	`	You go to your ship to retrieve the data and give it to him upon returning. His eyes light up with excitement as he makes a copy of the card and returns the original to you.`
		goto give
	label return
	`You return to Eruk's workshop and give him the data card. His eyes light up with excitement as he makes a copy of the card and returns the original to you.`
	label give
	`	"I have spent my whole life studying human culture," he says. "This is a treasure to me. And now, here is your speaking machine." He hands you a small, spherical device, with speakers and microphones mounted on it, as well as what look like camera lenses. "The device is programmed with the human and Hai languages," he says. "It is not always possible to translate perfectly between our two languages, but it will try to give you a sense of the range of meanings in what is being said."`
	choice
		`	"Thank you. I'm eager to try it out!"`
			accept
		`	"Is there anything else I need to know?"`
	`	He humors you by demonstrating how the machine works, holding a conversation with you where he speaks in the Hai language, and the machine automatically translates for you and then translates your responses back into his language. It apparently uses its cameras to track who you are speaking to or listening to. It's an impressive piece of technology, and easy enough to use. You thank him for his help, and return to your ship.`

	branch "alt start"
		has "Strider Alt Start: done"
	`You give the message from Sayari to the spaceport authorities so that they can deliver it to the council of elders. After the message has been delivered, the council requests that you meet with them.`
		goto start
	label "alt start"
	`	When you arrive on &#60;planet&#62;, you are quickly escorted from the spaceport to the council chambers.`
	label start
	`	"Greetings again, &#60;first&#62; &#60;last&#62;," one of the elders says to you. "It is our understanding that our Unfettered brothers and sisters have created a carrier ship. How difficult was it for you to combat it?"`
	choice
		`	"The carrier is strong, but not strong enough, and can be easily taken down."`
		`	"It was easy for me, but I can't say it will be the same for your ships to combat."`
		`	"It was a difficult fight, as the carrier is very powerful."`
	`	The elders mumble among themselves about this information, periodically glancing down at what must be the message from Sayari detailing the Solifuge.`
	`	"We gather a large fleet above Cloudfire," one of the elders says, "and shortly afterward the Unfettered unveil this new ship. Perhaps it is only right that we respond in kind with a ship of our own."`
	`	"My son is an engineer," another elder says. "He helped create our Centipede and Geocoris ships, both as a result of the humans living among us. Perhaps he would be of assistance in creating a ship to respond to the Unfettered." The elder presses a button and leans over to a microphone. "Please bring Osen into the council chamber."`
	`	A short while later, the elder's son enters the chamber and introduces himself to the council. They tell him about the Unfettered having created a carrier and the need for a new ship to be created as a response, and Osen's eyes go wide.`
	`	Osen begins speaking very quickly in the Hai language, so fast that your translation device seems to barely be able to keep up.`
	`	"I have [exactly, precisely] the ship! My team has been [developing, producing] a ship for many [years, cycles] that carries a [fleet, squadron] of drones. We have [working, functional] [prototypes, models], but they are not yet [finished, complete]. We are still [developing, producing] technology to repair the [hull, armor] of a ship in flight, which would make this ship and its drones much more [effective, powerful]."`
	`	The device continues speaking to you for nearly a minute after Osen stops talking (which is a little awkward as everyone stares at you). "Sorry, I wasn't aware that you had a translation device," Osen says, no longer speaking in Hai.`
	choice
		`	"It's alright."`
			goto next
		`	"You talk really fast."`
	`	Osen shrugs and smiles at you. "I speak fast when I'm excited."`
	label next
	`	"When is the earliest that you could provide these ships to us?" Osen's father asks.`
	`	"It would only be a few weeks for us to have a number of prototype ships ready, but I highly suggest that we wait until we have created hull repair technology. If these Unfettered Solifuges do not have such technology, then having it will give our ship an advantage by being able to redeploy damaged drones, but we believe that we are still many years away from developing technology strong enough to be of any real use."`
	`	The elders once again mumble among themselves. They continue to ask Osen a number of questions about this new carrier. How difficult is one to produce? How much does it cost? What are the capabilities of the drones? How useful would it be without being able to repair the hull of its drones?`
	`	After having all their questions answered, the elders seem to be interested in the idea of Osen's new ship. "This hull repair technology indeed sounds necessary," an elder says. "We will provide what funding we can to help fast track its development."`
	`	Osen's father turns to you. "You have traveled many systems, &#60;first&#62; &#60;last&#62;. Perhaps you might be able to help. If you know of any peoples who have such technology from elsewhere in the galaxy, should it exist, then perhaps we could meet with them."`
	branch "alt end"

	choice
		`	"I'm sorry, but I can't help right now. I need to return to the Wanderers."`
			goto busy
		`	"I'd be glad to help. I'm sure I could find someone with hull repair technology that could help."`
	`	"Sayari's message mentions that you are still needed by the Wanderers," Osen's father responds. "Perhaps you should return to where you are needed the most, but when you are able to help us, we will gladly accept it." The elders all thank you for bringing Sayari's message and bid you safe travels back to &#60;planet&#62;.`
		accept
	label busy
	`	"This is understandable," Osen's father responds. "Return to where you are needed, but when you are able to help, we will gladly accept it." The elders all thank you for bringing Sayari's message and bid you safe travels back to &#60;planet&#62;.`

	`	"This is understandable," Osen's father responds. "But we can be patient. Should you find time to help in the future, simply return to &#60;origin&#62; and inform the port authorities that you have what we seek, and we will meet with you again." The elders all thank you for giving them more information on the Unfettered Solifuge and bid you safe travels.`
		accept
	label glad
	`	"Wonderful," Osen's father responds. "Once you have finished looking, simply return to &#60;planet&#62; and inform the port authorities that you have what we seek, and we will meet with you again." The elders all thank you for giving them more information on the Unfettered Solifuge and bid you safe travels.`
